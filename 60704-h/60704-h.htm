<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">MORE than six centuries have passed since this
little Majorcan classic was written, and, so far
as I can find, it has never once been translated into
English. Such an omission can only be explained
by our comparative ignorance of the treasures of
Spanish Mysticism, and perhaps in part by the fact
that Lull wrote, not in Castilian, but in a little-known
though beautiful idiom, that of Catalonia.</p>

<p>It would have been attractive to reproduce the
original version of the book together with this translation,
and even more so to have translated the
whole of <i>Blanquerna</i>, of which it forms a part. I
hope that both these projects may be realised in the
future, together with the translations of (at least) <i>Els
Cent Noms de Deu</i>, <i>El Desconort</i>, and some of the
short hymns and poems. But it seemed best to
begin by making known some of Lull&#8217;s best work to
as wide a circle of readers as possible. Accordingly,
while following, as a rule, the oldest text (which is of
the fourteenth century) I have not scrupled to add
to my translation a few passages found only in the
editions of Paris (1505) and Valencia (1521), which
illuminate the author&#8217;s thought, or seem in other
ways to be of real value.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I have not allowed myself,
through a desire to expound Lull&#8217;s ideas, to substitute
paraphrase for faithful and exact translation.
Very few liberties have been taken with the text, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
these only where a slight expansion or change of
construction has served to bring out the meaning of
an otherwise quite obscure word or phrase. Essentially,
therefore, the reader has Lull&#8217;s own vivid and
forceful words, with the impediment of a foreign
language removed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTORY ESSAY</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE average man has seldom understood the
Mystic. He conceives the Mystic Life, with its
ceaseless spiritual activity, and its restlessness which
knows no stay till it reaches its goal, as a life of
tranquillity, if not of indolence and ease. He has no
conception of what it really is, and for that, perhaps,
he should not be blamed. But not content with
misinterpreting the mystic&#8217;s life, he presently becomes
more daring; he asserts that mysticism is
essentially &#8216;unpractical,&#8217; and that one whose aim is
to reach the state of Union with God must necessarily
be as a fool in his relations with the world. Here the
average man is grossly, inexcusably mistaken. His
error has again and again been exposed, confuted,
disproved by example after example to the contrary.
Yet, for all that, it seems to thrive in the
average mind.</p>

<p>Now, if the story of one man&#8217;s career could
suffice to destroy the mistaken idea that the mystic
is an unpractical dreamer, that man would surely be
the Majorcan Ramón Lull, the &#8216;Apostle of Africa.&#8217;
Lull lived far back in the thirteenth century, not
long after the days of St. Francis of Assisi, whose
disciple he was. He gives us, as it were, a prevision
of the splendours of that Golden Age of
Mysticism which dawned for Spain three hundred
years after his birth. His mystic writings&mdash;and especially
his <small>BOOK OF THE LOVER AND THE</small><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
<small>BELOVED</small>&mdash;are full of the purest and noblest
spirituality, compounded with the quintessence of
love. &#8216;If ye will have fire,&#8217; he cries, &#8216;O ye that love,
come light your lanterns at my heart.&#8217; His famous
phrase, &#8216;He who loves not lives not,&#8217; sums up his
inspiration. Yet Lull was no cloistered visionary.
His life is full of romance and adventure: so
crowded with incident is it that many pages will not
suffice even to summarise its principal happenings.
His capacities showed the rare combination of
scholar and man of affairs: he was both these, and
he was also the man of God. To the service of his
Master, for Whom alone he lived, and for Whom he
died, Lull was able to bring the full and complete
tribute of an efficient and active body, a superb
mind, and an ardent, unconquerable spirit.</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Ramón Lull</span> was born in Palma, the capital of
Majorca, on January 25, 1235. His father had taken
part in the conquest of Majorca from the Saracens
some six years earlier, and for his services had received
the gift of an estate, which his son inherited.
The boy was brought up as a page in the royal court
of Majorca, and, in spite of a sound religious education
and the interest and favour of the King, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
hardly reached years of discretion when he began to
lead a careless and dissolute life. His biographers
tell of how the King, to stop his degrading practices,
married him to a certain D<sup>a</sup>. Blanca Picañy,
but without thereby reforming him in the least.
Lull was chiefly enamoured of a Genoese lady, so
passionately that he dared one day to ride on horseback
into the Church of St. Eulalia, where she was
engaged in devotion. Eventually she herself
arrested his intrigues. Receiving from him some
gallant verses on the theme of her bosom, she called
him into her presence, and, uncovering herself
before him, disclosed a malignant cancer by which
her breast was slowly being consumed.</p>

<p>This terrible shock marked the first stage in
Lull&#8217;s conversion. He went back to the palace
another man&mdash;as taciturn and sombre as he had
formerly been gay and jovial. The tradition may
well be true that he saw at this time a vision of the
Crucified, saying, &#8216;Ramón, follow Me&#8217;: he himself
in some lines of autobiography tells us of five such
visions, though when they occurred is not certain.
Be this as it may, he turned from his evil life and
fixed his affections on God:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When I was grown and knew the world and its vanities,
I began to do evil and entered on sin. Forgetting the
true God I went after carnal things. But it pleased Jesus
Christ in His great pity to present Himself to me five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
times as if crucified, that I might remember Him and set
my love on Him, doing what I could that He might be
known through all the world and the truth be taught
concerning the great Trinity and the Incarnation. And
thus I was inspired and moved by so great love, that I
loved no other thing but that He should be honoured,
and I began to do Him willing service.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>From the first, as these lines significantly bear
evidence, Lull&#8217;s new ideals were directed towards
specific objects. He was set upon the conversion
of the Jews and Mohammedans who figured so
largely in thirteenth-century Spain. And setting
aside emotional methods as resolutely as the idea&mdash;so
general then&mdash;of conversion by force, he began
to ponder what he conceived to be worthy means of
compassing his aim&mdash;a progressive and unanswerable
appeal to the reason. A sermon heard on the
Feast of St. Francis (October 4, 1266) supplied the
spark which kindled Lull&#8217;s plans into action. He
sold all his land, with the exception of a portion
retained for himself and his family, gave up his
position of seneschal in the royal palace, and retired
first to a Cistercian monastery and later to Mount
Randa, near Palma, living there a life of study and
meditation with the object of fitting himself to
become a missionary to the Moslems.</p>

<p>The record of Lull&#8217;s life in Mount Randa is one
not only of prayer, fast and vigil, ecstasy and vision,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
but of the study of Arabic and the elaboration of his
scheme of a book which was to illuminate and convert
the world. He believed this <i>Art General</i> to be
directly inspired by the Holy Spirit. Once it was
sufficiently developed he turned in his practical way
to means by which its study could be advanced. To
King James II of Majorca were explained the
scholar&#8217;s vast plans for the conversion of Islam; the
King submitted them to one Bertram de Berengario,
a professor of theology, and, when satisfied of their
orthodoxy, endowed a college in Miramar for the
training in sciences and languages of thirteen
Franciscan missionaries to the Saracens (1275).
Thus one part of Lull&#8217;s ideals was realised.</p>

<p>For a short time he remained at Miramar,
teaching Arabic and the <i>Art General</i>. But before
long we find him lecturing on the <i>Art</i> in Montpellier,
which was part of the Majorcan kingdom. Then
he is at Rome, where his enterprise is sanctioned by
the Pope, and a School of Oriental Languages
founded. He spends two years lecturing in the
University of Paris, learning all the time as well as
teaching. A college is founded in Navarre through
King Philip of France. Lull goes farther afield&mdash;to
Palestine, Egypt, Ethiopia and Morocco. In
1282 we read of his being back in France again, at
Perpignan. Success continues to attend him, but
not in a measure that can satisfy his ardent soul.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Ever burning for more triumphs, he resolves at last
to put the lukewarmness of Europe to shame, and
to go himself to Africa as an Apostle of the Faith.</p>

<p>After some delay (the chronology of this period
is very uncertain<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>) he set sail from Genoa, and
landed in Tunis about 1291. Professing only a
desire to learn the truth&mdash;to convert or be converted
as events might prove&mdash;he began to debate in
public with the Moslems, following his own logical
method. He was only too successful. Many of
the infidels, attracted by his reasoning, embraced
Christianity; but the monarch began to fear for his
throne, and before long Lull found himself in
prison. Condemned to death for his preaching,
he was reprieved by the intercession of a Saracen of
influence, and banished from Africa, leaving Tunis
amid insults and blows, on pain of being stoned to
death should he ever return. For a time he evaded
his enemies and remained in the country, but a year
of this life showed him its futility, and he returned
to Naples. Here he remained writing and teaching
for a time; then he went to Rome (<i>c.</i> 1296), attempting
unsuccessfully to obtain sanction for new
missionary projects; again we find him in Genoa,
next in Paris (1297-8), back in Majorca, once more
in Genoa (1300), then on a new campaign in Cyprus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and Armenia (1300-2), back <i>via</i> Rhodes and Malta,
where he made stays, to Genoa and Paris (1303),
Palma, Barcelona, Lyon and Montpellier (1305).<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Here he saw both the King and Pope Clement V.
With the former he planned a crusade for the Holy
Land, but the latter, much occupied in other affairs,
gave him no support.</p>

<p>Everywhere and always evangelisation filled his
thoughts. No difficulty or objection, as the records
of these years show, could curb his zeal; the
thought of imprisonment or torture made no
difference to his plans, while to die a martyr&#8217;s death
when his work should be done was his great ambition.
&#8216;Foolish Lover,&#8217; says an imaginary opponent
to him in his little classic, &#8216;why dost thou weary the
body, throw away thy wealth and leave the joys of
this world, and go about as an outcast of the people?&#8217;
And his reply is the simplest imaginable. &#8216;To
honour my Beloved&#8217;s Name, for He is hated and
dishonoured by more men than honour and love
Him.&#8217;</p>

<p>In 1306 Lull determined to make an attempt to
preach once more in Africa. At the outset he was
successful, founding a school at Bona, where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
first went. But on proceeding to Bugia, and beginning
to preach in the market-place, he was
promptly arrested, all but stoned by the crowds,
summarily tried, and imprisoned in a loathsome
dungeon with a view to later execution. Something
in Lull&#8217;s personality, however (or, as some
say, the pleas of certain Catalan and Genoese inhabitants),
saved him once more; he was even allowed
the privilege of a disputation with a Mohammedan
champion, and eventually was exiled again in the
same year of his leaving Italy.</p>

<p>The ship in which he was returning suffered
shipwreck off Pisa, where he landed and remained
for two years. In Pisa he wrote a book incorporating
his memorable dispute with the Saracen
apologist and other experiences in Africa. But it
would seem that these experiences had been
modifying his belief in intellectual conversion, for
he approached Pope Clement V again with proposals
for a new crusade. Enthusiasm for crusades, however,
was a thing of the past, and neither the Pope
nor Italy as a whole gave the scheme any support.</p>

<p>So this dauntless fighter went once more to
Paris, which at that time was in the grip of Averroism,
and hence provided a new field for missionary
effort. Seventy-three years old as he was, Lull
lectured, wrote, and taught unceasingly against the
infidel philosophy, and won for himself fresh glory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
accomplishing in Europe what only physical force
withheld from him in Africa. King Philip, his
royal admirer, gave him the name of <i>docteur
illuminé</i>, by which, in one or another of its translations,
he is still known to-day.</p>

<p>The Council of Vienne (1311-2) gave Lull
another of those opportunities which he was never
slow to take. The picture of the venerable missionary
at the feet of the Head of the Church,
pouring forth his impassioned pleas for those enterprises
which authority so hesitated to allow, is
indeed a moving one. He painted the glory of
recovering the Holy Places, the plight of the Christians
in Armenia, and the peril which the Greeks
were in from the Turks&mdash;themes not exhausted
even after seven hundred years. These, however,
were but a few of Lull&#8217;s representations. The
number of his requests which were granted was
relatively small, but among them was a wider scheme
than any yet sanctioned for a system of colleges for
the teaching of missionary languages. This earnest
of the continuance of his work must have encouraged
beyond measure one who, in the natural course of
life, was nearing the end of his activities.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was this, indeed, which inspired him
to cross once more to Africa, to brave its terrors and
to suffer martyrdom for the Faith at last&mdash;as from
his conversion he had wished&mdash;if it might be the will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of God. And the will of God it proved to be. On
August 14, 1314, he set out from Palma for Bugia.
On his arrival he began his work less openly than
before, and for some months contrived to preach
secretly, make conversions and confirm the faithful
of earlier days. He passed to Tunis, where he had
further success, but for some unknown reason was
compelled to return to Bugia. Success made him
bold. Feeling perhaps that the hour of supreme
effort&mdash;even if it meant the supreme sacrifice&mdash;had
come, he threw prudence to the winds, assembled a
vast concourse, and, proclaiming himself that same
Ramón who had formerly been condemned in Bugia,
he preached once more the faith of the Saviour.
This time the crowd broke loose, and not only
clamoured for Lull&#8217;s death, but took him out of the
city and stoned him (June 30, 1315), even as a
Jewish mob had stoned the first of Christian
martyrs.</p>

<p>Various accounts are given of his burial. It
seems that two Genoese merchants begged his body
and carried it to Majorca, but some versions have it
that a great pyramid of light aided them in their
search for it, that life remained in the body until it
reached Palma, and that adverse winds forced the
vessel, which was making for Genoa, to land at
Lull&#8217;s birthplace. Here the body was received with
the greatest sorrow and mourning, and buried with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
due solemnity in the sacristy of the convent of St.
Francis of Assisi.</p>

<p>Ramón Lull was beatified by Pius IX. The
title-page of his great romance, <i>Blanquerna</i>, calls him
&#8216;Doctor illuminate, Martyr unconquered of Jesus
Christ, Master universal in all arts and sciences.&#8217;
But in his own country Lull receives the simpler
homage of a saint.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The foregoing sketch, for all its brevity, will have
emphasised more forcibly than much argument the
practical and the scholarly sides of Lull&#8217;s temperament.
We shall say nothing here of the four
hundred and eighty-six treatises<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> which he is known
to have written, nor of the thousands of other works,
no longer extant if indeed they ever existed, with
which he is credited. Nor is there need to describe
his system and doctrine, at once scholastic and
popular in character. The <i>Libre de Amich e Amat</i>,
which is here translated, is purely a mystical work,
and this essay is concerned with the mystical side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Lull&#8217;s mind, so wonderfully illumined by the flame
which burnt through his long life of self-sacrifice.</p>

<p><i>The Book of the Lover and the Beloved</i> takes us
from the African preachings and the disputations of
the Sorbonne to those long night-watches and days of
retreat which must always have accompanied them,
but which we are apt to forget in contemplating
that form of activity which the world counts greatest.
Or the thoughts which the <i>Book</i> gives us may first
have come to the young convert in the solitude of
his monastery and the retreat of Mount Randa.
Rosselló, who some sixty years ago first published
Lull&#8217;s poems, interprets a passage from <i>Blanquerna</i>
as autobiographical. It may well be so.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Being then in his hermitage he would rise at midnight,
and, opening the windows of his cell, would fall to contemplating
the heavens and the stars, and praying with all
possible devotion, that his soul might be fixed upon God
alone.... After long contemplation and much weeping,
his custom was to enter the church and ring for mattins,
and when his deacon appeared, to help him say them. At
daybreak he celebrated Mass with devotion, and spoke of
God with his deacon, that on God he might set his love.
And as they talked together of God and His works, they
both wept for the greatness of the devotion which their
argument inspired in them. Then the deacon went into
the garden and busied himself with the cultivation of the
trees in it, while Blanquerna left the church to recreate
his mind which was wearied by the work he had done,
to lift his eyes to the hills, and to let them rest on the
plains beneath. Feeling rested at last, he would betake
himself again to meditation and prayer, and the reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of Holy Scripture or the great book of <i>Contemplation</i>, and
so he would be occupied until the hours of Terce, Sext and
Nones.... After this he dined ... and went into the
garden, visited the spring, or walked in the places he loved
most, afterwards giving himself up for a while to sleep in
order to gather strength for the labours of the night. On
awaking he said vespers with the deacon, and then remained
alone, thinking on what pleased him most and
was fittest preparation for his hours of prayer. After
sunset, he went up to the terrace, and there remained long
in devout meditation, his eyes fixed on the heavens and
the stars, discoursing with himself on the greatness of
God and man&#8217;s inconstancies. In this state he remained
until he retired to rest, and such was the fervour of his
contemplation that even upon his bed he found himself in
mystic converse with the All-Powerful.</p></blockquote>

<p>Such a background as this we must almost of
necessity assume in a life at once so active and so
spiritual. No doubt Lull was able often to spend
weeks, or at the least days, in some sacred retreat,
and draw from God and from Nature strength and
inspiration for his endless tasks. To these seasons of
refreshing, it may be supposed, we owe his mystical
writings.</p>

<p>Of Lull&#8217;s verses many are narrative or doctrinal:
the hymns entitled &#8216;Hours of Our Lady St. Mary&#8217;
(<i>Horas de Nostra Dona Sancta Maria</i>), for example;
the &#8216;Sin of Adam&#8217; (<i>Lo Peccat de n&#8217;Adam</i>), written
&#8216;at the request of the King of Majorca&#8217;; the short
&#8216;Song of Ramón&#8217; (<i>Lo Cant de Ramón</i>), and above
all the &#8216;Medicine for Sin&#8217; (<i>Medicina de Peccat</i>) and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the purely didactic verse &#8216;Application&#8217; of the <i>Art
General</i>. The collection of a hundred songs on the
Names of God (<i>Els Cent Noms de Deu</i>), on the other
hand, is more mystical than doctrinal, and suggests,
in matter as well as in title, the mystical treatise &#8216;Of
the Names of Christ&#8217; (<i>De los Nombres de Cristo</i>)
written almost exactly three hundred years later by
the Salamancan friar, Luis de León. Mystical
too, as well as autobiographical, is the dialogue
poem <i>El Desconort</i>, &#8216;made in his old age,&#8217; though
its spirit is that of disillusion at the refusal of those
in high places to help forward his schemes of
evangelisation. But neither of these has either
the strength or the beauty of the collection of prose
poems here translated, a collection which forms
part of the novel-like <i>Blanquerna</i>, Lull&#8217;s chief contribution
to mystical literature.</p>

<p>His chief contribution it is, mainly, though not
entirely, by virtue of the sections entitled the <i>Art
of Contemplation</i> and our <i>Book of the Lover and the
Beloved</i>. <i>Blanquerna</i>, as a whole, is a somewhat
fantastic, and in places extravagant, religious romance&mdash;a
religious <i>Utopia</i>, if parallels to it must
be found, or a Catholic <i>Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</i>. The
story is of a certain gallant and wealthy youth named
Evast, who marries a beautiful and virtuous girl
called Aloma. They live together in great piety
and happiness, but have no children, until Aloma in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
her sorrow prays to God, and a boy, Blanquerna, is
born to them. The child is brought up with great
care, and in the fear of God; and when his father
sees that he is a youth of discretion, he resolves to
devote himself to the religious life. Aloma, however,
disapproves, saying that they can both serve
God best in the state to which He has called them;
they decide in the end to lead lives of greater
austerity in their home, and to give Blanquerna the
oversight of the household. But, on proposing this
to the boy, they find that he has resolved to become
a hermit.</p>

<p>Aloma is grieved, and endeavours to marry
Blanquerna to a beautiful girl called Cana. Blanquerna&#8217;s
reply is to persuade Cana to become a nun,
while he himself retires to the desert to carry out his
resolve. The story then describes circumstantially
and with some prolixity the lives of Evast and Aloma
after Blanquerna has left them; it passes on to Cana,
who eventually becomes abbess of her convent; and
finally, after some long digressions upon convent life,
to the later history of Blanquerna, which occupies
the rest of the romance.</p>

<p>The second book of <i>Blanquerna</i> deals with the
hero&#8217;s life before he is ordained priest and rises to
the rank of abbot in the monastery which he has
entered. A digression follows, entitled &#8216;The Book
of Ave Maria,&#8217; purporting to be an account of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
devotions to Our Lady which the hero established.
The third book presents him as a bishop, and the
fourth as pope.</p>

<p>The various religious ideals presented by Lull in
succession lead up to the great ideal of his life: the
evangelisation of the world. Blanquerna&#8217;s supreme
aim as pope is to strive &#8216;that all infidels and schismatics
may be brought into the union of the Holy
Catholic Faith.&#8217; His cardinals are quaintly named
after the clauses of the <i>Gloria in Excelsis Deo</i>, and
every clause is expounded so as to illustrate the
activity which the Church should show in converting
the heathen.</p>

<p>To the court of the Pope comes at length a
jester,&mdash;one Ramón the Fool,&mdash;none other, of
course, than Lull himself. &#8216;I would be as a fool,&#8217;
he says, &#8216;to do reverence and honour to Jesus
Christ, and by reason of my exceeding love I would
know no measure in my speech.&#8217; Thus disguised,
the author can write much which he might not
otherwise have dared to put into words. And above
all he can deliver himself of the shame he feels
because the Head of the Church will grant so little
aid to those who aim at following Christ&#8217;s last
recorded command to convert all nations.</p>

<p>The story ends with the decision of Blanquerna,
the pope now grown old in the service of the
Church and the conversion of the heathen, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
renounce his high office, retire to a hermitage, and
devote his last days to contemplation and prayer.
His new life is described in detail, and it is interwoven
with this description that we come upon the
<i>Book of the Lover and the Beloved</i> and the <i>Art of
Contemplation</i>.</p>

<p>The former is by far the simpler and more
appealing of the two, the <i>Art of Contemplation</i> being
considerably longer and full of doctrinal teaching.
It is, nevertheless, still read, less for its didactic
passages than for its close relation with the whole
romance, its mystical aspect, and in particular its
prayers, which are of great beauty. The <i>Book of the
Lover and the Beloved</i> is mystical throughout. It
was written, the author himself declares, &#8216;that the
hearts of men might be moved to true contrition,
their eyes to abundance of tears, and their wills and
understandings to loftier flights in the contemplation
of God.&#8217; How well it attains its object, and how
truly it reflects the mystic&#8217;s being, the reader must
judge.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>We have no wish to add to these few notes a lengthy
commentary upon the substance of a book which,
probably for the first time, is accessible to those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
read only English. Scholars have debated over
Lull&#8217;s probable debt to sufism, on the one hand,
and, on the other, his influence upon the long line
of mystics who have followed him. There is much
still to be said upon these and other topics, much
that will throw fresh light on Spain and Spanish
mysticism both. But in this essay enough has
been said of Lull&#8217;s life and works to form the indispensable
prelude to his <i>Book</i>. For the present,
therefore, we prefer to stand back, and allow Lull&#8217;s
ardent spirit to work its miracles still. Work them
it surely must. Writing in his native &#8216;catalan-provenzal,&#8217;
that he might appeal, not to learned
men, but to the people, by the people he is read still.
He needs none of the &#8216;Expositions,&#8217; such as were
written in his own age and as late as the seventeenth
century. Here and there a passage confuses the
modern mind by its mediæval subtleties; or the
frequent references to the will, understanding, and
memory (so common in most of the mystics) may
puzzle the simple reader until he has learned to
interpret them. But the vast majority of the three
hundred and sixty-six &#8216;verses,&#8217; put together to be
read one on each day of the year, may still so be read.
They speak to the twentieth century as clearly,
picturesquely, and forcibly as they spoke to the
thirteenth. Have we perhaps even more need of
their message?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>They speak of elementals. Like his great successors
St. Teresa and St. John of the Cross, Lull
knows no Master but his Beloved, Jesus Christ; he
surpasses them perhaps in this, that he is never
unmindful of the world his Beloved came to save.
His is no cloistered love. He could never say, with
St. John of the Cross, &#8216;Live in the world as though
there were in it but God and thy soul.&#8217; Ringing
for ever in his ears is the Beloved&#8217;s last command.</p>

<p>Never was &#8216;Love&#8217;s regal dalmatic&#8217; worn with
more grace and fitness than by this &#8216;jester,&#8217; this
&#8216;fool of love.&#8217; It is no compliment to Lull to call
him, as the great scholar Menéndez Pelayo does,
a &#8216;Spanish Jacopone da Todi.&#8217; Jacopone, it is true,
sang of love with unsurpassable fervour:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Amor, amore, tanto tu me fai,</div>
<div class="verse">Amore, amor, che nol posso patire;</div>
<div class="verse">Amor, amore, tanto me te dai,</div>
<div class="verse">Amor, amore, ben credo morire;</div>
<div class="verse">Amore, amore, tanto preso m&#8217;hai,</div>
<div class="verse">Amor, amore, famme &#8217;n te transire;</div>
<div class="verse">Amor, dolce languire,</div>
<div class="verse">Amor mio desioso,</div>
<div class="verse">Amor mio delettoso,</div>
<div class="verse">Annegame en amore.</div>
</div></div>

<p>But Lull, who, like Jacopone, owed most of his
fervour, under God, to St. Francis, has a note of his
own, no less deep, no less pure. His key is perhaps
in that eloquent definition, which has been slightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
expanded in translation that the full force of every
phrase may be felt:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8216;What meanest thou by love?&#8217; said the Beloved. And
the Lover answered: &#8216;It is to bear on one&#8217;s heart the
sacred marks and the sweet words of the Beloved. It is
to long for Him with desire and with tears. It is boldness.
It is fervour. It is fear. It is the desire for the
Beloved above all things. It is that which causes the
Lover to grow faint when he hears the Beloved&#8217;s praises.
It is that in which I die daily, and in which is all my will.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Lull might well have written, as did a late Franciscan,
John of the Angels, of the &#8216;Triumphs of the Love of
God.&#8217;</p>

<p>Love impels him to tread the Mystic Way &#8216;in
search of his Beloved.&#8217; Much of his <i>Book</i>, therefore,
deals with the Mystic Life. But it has none
of the exclusiveness of the <i>Living Flame of Love</i> and
the <i>Spiritual Canticle</i>. There are passages for the
beginner as well as for the proficient, parables in
three lines for the plain man, sermons in phrases,
reflections which, by their very simplicity, kindle the
devotion of the wayfaring man as he reads them.
As we read the brief records of imaginary conversations
between the Lover and &#8216;those who asked him
concerning his Beloved,&#8217; we can imagine ourselves
in some African coast-town where the stranger who
has just landed is being pressed, by the surging
crowd which surrounds him, to give reasons for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
faith. The calm and confident answers supply the
secret of Lull&#8217;s power.</p>

<p>Then we come upon some quaintly-worded,
paradoxical phrase which only reflection will
illumine and meditation make real. And we know
that we are following in the path of Lull when he
composed his treatise. For it was the fruit, not of
subtleties, but of silence. &#8216;He would engage in
prayer,&#8217; runs the preface, &#8216;and meditate upon God
and His virtues, after which he would write down
the outcome of his contemplation.&#8217; And again,
more concretely: &#8216;At midnight he arose, looked
out upon the heavens and the stars, and cast away
from him all thoughts of the world.&#8217;</p>

<p>So, between meditation and prayer, he wrote
this masterpiece in little, signed it with his
Beloved&#8217;s Sign, and sent it out to a world which
he longed to save. It has been potent in the past,
and we may believe that it will be so again. For
it is as eternal and universal in its appeal as the
Ideal Life which it extols. Nurtured by experience,
watered by faith, it is rooted and grounded
in love.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE BOOK OF THE LOVER<br />
AND THE BELOVED</h2></div>


<p>1 &nbsp; The Lover asked his Beloved if there remained
in Him anything still to be loved. And the Beloved
replied that he had still to love that by which his
own love could be increased.</p>

<p>2 &nbsp; Long and perilous are the paths by which the
Lover seeks his Beloved. They are peopled by
cares, sighs and tears. They are lit up by love.</p>

<p>3 &nbsp; Many Lovers came together to love One only,
their Beloved, who made them all to abound in love.
And each declared his Beloved perfection, and his
thoughts of Him were very pleasant, making him
to suffer pain which brought delight.</p>

<p>4 &nbsp; The Lover wept and said: &#8216;How long shall it
be till the darkness of the world is past, that the
mad rush of men towards hell may cease? When
comes the hour in which water, that flows downwards,
shall change its nature and mount upwards?
When shall the innocent be more in number than
the guilty? Ah! When shall the Lover with joy
lay down his life for the Beloved? And when shall
the Beloved see the Lover grow faint for love of
Him?&#8217;</p>

<p>5 &nbsp; Said the Lover to the Beloved: &#8216;Thou that
fillest the sun with splendour, fill my heart with
love.&#8217; And the Beloved answered: &#8216;Wert thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
not filled with love, thine eyes had not shed those
tears, nor hadst thou come to this place to see thy
Beloved.&#8217;</p>

<p>6 &nbsp; The Beloved made trial of His Lover to see if
his love for Him were perfect, and He asked him
how the presence of the Beloved differed from
His absence. The Lover answered: &#8216;As knowledge
and remembrance differ from ignorance and
oblivion.&#8217;</p>

<p>7 &nbsp; The Beloved asked the Lover: &#8216;Hast thou
remembrance of anything with which I have rewarded
thee, that thou wouldst love Me thus?&#8217;
&#8216;Yea,&#8217; replied the Lover, &#8216;for I distinguish not
between the trials that Thou sendest me and the
joys.&#8217;</p>

<p>8 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Lover,&#8217; asked the Beloved, &#8216;if I double
thy trials, wilt thou still be patient?&#8217; &#8216;Yea,&#8217;
answered the Lover, &#8216;so that Thou double also my
love.&#8217;</p>

<p>9 &nbsp; Said the Beloved to the Lover: &#8216;Knowest thou
yet what love meaneth?&#8217; The Lover replied: &#8216;If
I knew not the meaning of love, I should know the
meaning of labour, grief and sorrow.&#8217;</p>

<p>10 &nbsp; They asked the Lover: &#8216;Why answerest thou
not thy Beloved when He calleth thee?&#8217; He replied:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
&#8216;I brave great perils that He may come,
and I speak to Him begging His graces.&#8217;</p>

<p>11 &nbsp; &#8216;Foolish Lover, why dost thou weary thy
body, throw away thy wealth and leave the joys
of this world, and go about as an outcast of the
people?&#8217; &#8216;To honour my Beloved&#8217;s Name,&#8217; he
replied, &#8216;for He is hated and dishonoured by more
men than honour and love Him.&#8217;</p>

<p>12 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, Fool of Love, which can be the better
seen, the Beloved in the Lover, or the Lover in the
Beloved?&#8217; The Lover answered, and said: &#8216;By
love can the Beloved be seen, and the Lover by
sighs and tears, by grief and by labours.&#8217;</p>

<p>13 &nbsp; The Lover sought for one who should tell his
Beloved how great trials he was enduring for love
of Him, and how he was like to die. And he found
his Beloved, who was reading in a book wherein
were written all the griefs which love made him
to suffer for his Beloved, and the graces which He
gave him.</p>

<p>14 &nbsp; Our Lady presented her Son to the Lover,
that he might kiss His feet, and that he might write
in his book concerning Our Lady&#8217;s virtues.</p>

<p>15 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, thou bird that singest, hast thou placed
thyself in the care of my Beloved, that He may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
guard thee from indifference, and increase in thee
thy love?&#8217; The bird replied: &#8216;And who makes
me to sing but the Lord of love, to whom not to
love is to sin.&#8217;</p>

<p>16 &nbsp; Between Hope and Fear, Love made her home.
She lives on thought, and, when she is forgotten,
dies. So unlike the pleasures of this world are her
foundations.</p>

<p>17 &nbsp; There was a contention between the eyes and
the memory of the Lover, for the eyes said that it
was better to see the Beloved than to remember
Him. But Memory said that remembrance brings
tears to the eyes, and makes the heart to burn with
love.</p>

<p>18 &nbsp; The Lover asked the Understanding and the
Will which of them was the nearer to his Beloved.
And the two ran, and the Understanding came
nearer to the Beloved than did the Will.</p>

<p>19 &nbsp; There was strife between the Lover and the
Beloved, and another who loved Him saw it and
wept, till peace and concord were made between the
Beloved and the Lover.</p>

<p>20 &nbsp; Sighs and Tears came to be judged by the
Beloved, and asked Him which of them loved Him
the more deeply. And the Beloved gave judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
that sighs were nearer to the seat of love, and tears
to the eyes.</p>

<p>21 &nbsp; The Lover came to drink of the fountain which
gives love to him who has none, and his griefs redoubled.
And the Beloved came to drink of the
same fountain, that the love of one whose griefs were
doubled might be doubled also.</p>

<p>22 &nbsp; The Lover fell sick and thought on the Beloved,
who fed him on His merits, quenched his thirst with
love, made him to rest in patience, clothed him with
humility, and as medicine gave him truth.</p>

<p>23 &nbsp; They asked the Lover where his Beloved was.
And he answered: &#8216;See Him for yourselves in a
nobler house than all the nobility of creation; but
see Him too in my love, my griefs and my tears.&#8217;</p>

<p>24 &nbsp; They said to the Lover: &#8216;Whither goest
thou?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;I come from my Beloved.&#8217;
&#8216;Whence comest thou?&#8217; &#8216;I go to my Beloved.&#8217;
&#8216;When wilt thou return?&#8217; &#8216;I shall be with my
Beloved.&#8217; &#8216;How long wilt thou be with thy Beloved?&#8217;
&#8216;As long as my thoughts remain on Him.&#8217;</p>

<p>25 &nbsp; The birds hymned the dawn, and the Beloved,
who is the dawn, awakened. And the birds ended
their song, and the Lover died in the dawn for his
Beloved.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>26 &nbsp; The bird sang in the garden of the Beloved.
The Lover came, and he said to the bird: &#8216;If we
understand not one another&#8217;s speech, we may
make ourselves understood by love; for in thy song
I see my Beloved before mine eyes.&#8217;</p>

<p>27 &nbsp; The Lover was wearied, for he had laboured
much in seeking for his Beloved; and he feared lest
he should forget Him. And he wept, that he
might not fall asleep, and his Beloved be absent from
his remembrance.</p>

<p>28 &nbsp; The Lover and the Beloved met, and the
Beloved said to the Lover: &#8216;Thou needest not to
speak to Me. Look at Me only,&mdash;for thine eyes
speak to My heart,&mdash;that I may give thee what thou
willest.&#8217;</p>

<p>29 &nbsp; The Lover was disobedient to his Beloved; and
the Lover wept. And the Beloved came in the
venture of His Lover, and died, that His Lover might
regain what he had lost. So He gave him a greater
gift than that which he had lost.</p>

<p>30 &nbsp; The Beloved filled His Lover with gifts of love,
and grieved not for his tribulations, for they would
but make him love the more deeply; and the
greater the Lover&#8217;s tribulations, the greater was his
joy and delight.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>31 &nbsp; The Lover said: &#8216;The secrets of my Beloved
torture me, for my deeds reveal them not, and my
mouth keeps silence and reveals them to none.&#8217;</p>

<p>32 &nbsp; This is Love&#8217;s contract: the Lover must be
long-suffering, patient, humble, fearful, diligent,
trustful; he must be ready to face great dangers for
the honour of his Beloved. And his Beloved is
pledged to be true and free, just and liberal with
those that love Him.</p>

<p>33 &nbsp; The Lover set forth over hill and plain in
search of true devotion, and to see if his Beloved was
well served. But everywhere he found nought but
indifference. And so he delved into the earth to
see if there he could find the devotion which was
lacking above ground.</p>

<p>34 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, thou bird that singest of love, why does
my Beloved, He who has made me His servant, do
nought but torture me now?&#8217; And the bird
replied: &#8216;If Love made thee not to bear trials,
what couldst thou give to show thy love for Him?&#8217;</p>

<p>35 &nbsp; Pensively the Lover trod those paths which lead
to the Beloved. Now he stumbled and fell among
the thorns; but they were to him as flowers, and as
a bed of love.</p>

<p>36 &nbsp; They asked the Lover: &#8216;Wilt thou for another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
change thy Beloved?&#8217; And he answered: &#8216;Why,
what other is better or nobler than He? For
He is the supreme Good; He is infinite and
eternal, in greatness, wisdom and love; nay, He is
perfection.&#8217;</p>

<p>37 &nbsp; The Lover wept, and sang of his Beloved, and
said: &#8216;Swifter is love in the lover&#8217;s heart than is the
brilliance of the lightning to the eye, or the thunder
to the ear. The tears of love gather more swiftly
than the waves of the sea; and sighing is more
proper to love than is whiteness to snow.&#8217;</p>

<p>38 &nbsp; They asked the Lover: &#8216;Wherein is the glory
of thy Beloved?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;He is Glory
itself.&#8217; They asked him: &#8216;Wherein lies His
power?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;He is Power itself.&#8217;
&#8216;And wherein lies His wisdom?&#8217; &#8216;He is Wisdom
itself.&#8217; &#8216;And wherefore is He to be loved?&#8217;
&#8216;Because He is Love itself.&#8217;</p>

<p>39 &nbsp; The Lover rose early and went to seek his
Beloved. He found travellers on the road, and he
asked if they had seen his Beloved. They answered
him: &#8216;When did the eyes of thy mind lose sight of
thy Beloved?&#8217; The Lover replied: &#8216;Since I first
saw my Beloved in my thoughts, He has never been
absent from the eyes of my body, for all things that
I see picture to me my Beloved.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>40 &nbsp; With eyes of thought and grief, sighs and tears
the Lover gazed upon the Beloved; and with eyes
of grace, justice and piety, mercy and bounty, the
Beloved gazed upon His Lover. And the bird sang
of that Countenance so full of delight, as we have
already said.</p>

<p>41 &nbsp; The keys of the gates of love are gilded with cares
and desires, sighs and tears; the cord which binds
them is woven of conscience, devotion, contrition and
atonement; the door is kept by justice and mercy.</p>

<p>42 &nbsp; The Lover beat upon his Beloved&#8217;s door with
blows of love and hope. The Beloved heard His
Lover&#8217;s blows, with humility, piety, charity and
patience. Deity and Humanity opened the doors,
and the Lover went in to his Beloved.</p>

<p>43 &nbsp; Deity and Humanity met, and joined together
to make concord between Lover and Beloved.</p>

<p>44 &nbsp; There are two fires that warm the love of a true
Lover: one is of pleasures, desires and thoughts:
the other is of weeping and crying, of fear and grief.</p>

<p>45 &nbsp; The Lover longed for solitude, and went away
to live alone, that he might gain the companionship
of his Beloved, for amid many people he was lonely.</p>

<p>46 &nbsp; The Lover was all alone, in the shade of a great
tree. Men passed by that place, and asked him why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
he was alone. And the Lover replied: &#8216;I am
alone, now that I have seen you and heard you;
until now, I was in the company of my Beloved.&#8217;</p>

<p>47 &nbsp; By signs of love, the Lover held converse with
the Beloved; by means of fear and thought, weeping
and crying, the Lover recounted his griefs to the
Beloved.</p>

<p>48 &nbsp; The Lover feared whether his Beloved would
fail him in his greatest need; and he ceased from
loving Him. Then he had contrition and repentance
of heart; and the Beloved restored hope and
charity to the Lover&#8217;s heart, and tears to his eyes,
that love might return to him.</p>

<p>49 &nbsp; Whether Lover and Beloved are near or far is
all one; for their love mingles as water mingles with
wine. They are linked as heat with light; they
approach and are united as Essence and Being.</p>

<p>50 &nbsp; Said the Lover to the Beloved: &#8216;My grief and
its healing are both in Thee: the more surely Thou
healed me, the greater grows my grief; when Thou
dost wound me, even then dost Thou give me health.&#8217;</p>

<p>51 &nbsp; The Lover sighed and said: &#8216;Ah! What is my
love?&#8217; The Beloved answered: &#8216;Thy love is a
mark and a seal by which thou dost show forth My
honour before men.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>52 &nbsp; The Lover saw himself taken and bound,
wounded and killed, for the love of his Beloved; and
those who tortured him asked him: &#8216;Where is thy
Beloved?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;See Him here in the
increase of my love, and the Strength which it gives
me to bear my torments.&#8217;</p>

<p>53 &nbsp; Said the Lover to the Beloved: &#8216;I have never
fled from Thee, nor ceased to love Thee, since I
knew Thee, for I was ever in Thee, by Thee and
with Thee wheresoever I went.&#8217; The Beloved
answered: &#8216;Nor since thou hast known Me and
loved Me have I once forgotten thee; never once
have I deceived or failed thee.&#8217;</p>

<p>54 &nbsp; As though mad went the Lover through a city,
singing of his love; and they asked him if he had
lost his senses. &#8216;My Beloved,&#8217; he answered, &#8216;has
taken my will, and I myself have yielded up to Him
my understanding; so that there is left in me
naught but memory, with which I remember my
Beloved.&#8217;</p>

<p>55 &nbsp; The Beloved said: &#8216;It would be a miracle that
the Lover should sleep and forget the love of the
Beloved.&#8217; The Lover replied: &#8216;It would be a
greater miracle yet if the Beloved did not awaken
him, since He has desired his love.&#8217;</p>

<p>56 &nbsp; The heart of the Lover soared to the heights of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the Beloved&#8217;s abode, so that he might not lose his
love for Him in the deep places of this world. And
when he reached his Beloved he contemplated Him
with joy and delight. But the Beloved led him
down again to this world to make trial of him with
tribulations and adversities.</p>

<p>57 &nbsp; They asked the Lover: &#8216;Wherein is all thy
wealth?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;In the poverty which
I bear for my Beloved.&#8217; &#8216;And where dost thou
rest?&#8217; &#8216;In the afflictions of love.&#8217; &#8216;Who is thy
physician?&#8217; &#8216;The trust I have in my Beloved.&#8217;
&#8216;And who is thy master?&#8217; &#8216;The signs which in
all creatures I see of my Beloved.&#8217;</p>

<p>58 &nbsp; The bird sang upon a branch in leaf and flower,
and the breeze caused the leaves to tremble, and
bore away the scent of the flowers. &#8216;What means
the trembling of the leaves, and the scent of
the flowers?&#8217; asked the bird of the Lover.
He answered: &#8216;The trembling of the leaves
signifies obedience, and the scent of the flowers,
adversity.&#8217;</p>

<p>59 &nbsp; The Lover went in desire of his Beloved and
met two friends, who greeted each other lovingly,
with kisses, embraces and tears. And the Lover
swooned, so strongly did these two lovers call to his
memory his Beloved.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>60 &nbsp; The Lover thought on death, and was afraid,
till he remembered his Beloved. Then in a loud
voice he cried to those who were near: &#8216;Ah, sirs!
have love, that you may fear neither death nor
danger, in doing honour to my Beloved.&#8217;</p>

<p>61 &nbsp; They asked the Lover where his love first
began. And he replied: &#8216;It began in the glory of
my Beloved; and from that beginning I was led to
love my neighbour even as myself, and to cease to
care for deception and falsehood.&#8217;</p>

<p>62 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, Fool of Love, if thy Beloved no longer
cared for thee, what wouldst thou do?&#8217; &#8216;I should
love Him still,&#8217; he replied. &#8216;Else must I die;
seeing that to cease to love is death and love is life.&#8217;</p>

<p>63 &nbsp; They asked the Lover what he meant by perseverance.
&#8216;It is both happiness and sorrow,&#8217; he
answered, &#8216;in the Lover who ever loves, honours and
serves his Beloved with courage, patience and hope.&#8217;</p>

<p>64 &nbsp; The Lover desired his Beloved to recompense
him for the time of his service. And the Beloved
reckoned the thoughts, tears, longings, perils and
trials which His Lover had borne for love of Him;
and the Beloved added to the account eternal bliss,
and gave Himself for a recompense to His Lover.</p>

<p>65 &nbsp; They asked the Lover what he meant by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
happiness. &#8216;It is sorrow,&#8217; he replied, &#8216;borne for
Love&#8217;s sake.&#8217; &#8216;O Fool,&#8217; they answered, &#8216;what,
then, is sorrow?&#8217; &#8216;It is the remembrance of dishonour
done to my Beloved, who is worthy of all
honour.&#8217; And they asked him again: &#8216;What is
misery?&#8217; &#8216;To get one&#8217;s desires in this world,&#8217;
he replied, &#8216;for such fleeting joys are followed by
perpetual torment.&#8217;</p>

<p>66 &nbsp; The Lover was gazing on a Place where he had
seen his Beloved. And he said: &#8216;Ah, place that
recalled the blessed haunts of my Beloved! Thou
wilt tell my Beloved that I suffer trials and griefs for
His sake.&#8217; And that Place made reply: &#8216;When thy
Beloved hung upon me, He bore for thy love
greater trials and sorrows than all other trials and
sorrows that Love could give to its servants.&#8217;</p>

<p>67 &nbsp; Said the Lover to his Beloved: &#8216;Thou art all,
and through all, and in all, and with all. I would
give Thee all of myself that I may have all of Thee,
and Thou all of me.&#8217; The Beloved answered:
&#8216;Thou canst not have Me wholly unless thou art
wholly Mine.&#8217; And the Lover said: &#8216;Let me be
wholly Thine and be Thou wholly mine.&#8217; The
Beloved answered: &#8216;If I am wholly thine, what
part in Me will thy son have, thy brother, thy sister
and thy father?&#8217; The Lover replied: &#8216;Thou, O
my Beloved! art so great a Whole, that Thou canst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
abound, and yet be wholly of each one who gives
himself wholly to Thee.&#8217;</p>

<p>68 &nbsp; The Lover thought long and deeply on the
greatness and everlastingness of his Beloved, and
he found in Him neither beginning, nor mean, nor
end. And the Beloved said: &#8216;What art thou
measuring, O Fool?&#8217; The Lover answered: &#8216;I
am measuring greater with lesser, fullness with want,
infinity with quantity, and eternity with time. And
this I do that humility and patience, faith, love and
hope may enter more deeply into my mind.&#8217;</p>

<p>69 &nbsp; The paths of love are both long and short. For
love is clear, pure and bright, subtle yet simple,
strong, diligent, brilliant, and abounding both in
fresh thoughts and in old memories.</p>

<p>70 &nbsp; They asked the Lover: &#8216;What are the fruits
of love?&#8217; And the Lover made answer: &#8216;They
are pleasures, thoughts, desires, trials, perils,
torments, sighs and griefs. And without these
fruits Love&#8217;s servants have no part in her.&#8217;</p>

<p>71 &nbsp; Many persons were with the Lover, who was
complaining of his Beloved that He increased not
his love, and of Love, that it gave him so many
trials and sorrows. The Beloved made reply that
the trials and sorrows for which he reproached Love
were that very increase of love.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>72 &nbsp; The Lover entered a delightful meadow, and
saw in the meadow many children who were
pursuing butterflies, and trampling down the
flowers; and, the more the children laboured to
catch the butterflies, the higher did these fly. And
the Lover, as he watched them, said: &#8216;Such are
they who with subtle reasoning attempt to comprehend
the Beloved, Who opens the doors to the
simple and closes them to the subtle. And Faith
reveals the secrets of the Beloved through the
casement of love.&#8217;</p>

<p>73 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, Fool of Love, why dost thou not speak,
and what is this for which thou art thoughtful and
perplexed?&#8217; The Lover answered: &#8216;I am thinking
of the beauties of my Beloved, and the likeness
between the bliss and the sorrow which are brought
me by the gifts of Love.&#8217;</p>

<p>74 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, Fool, which was in being first, thy heart
or thy love?&#8217; He answered and said: &#8216;Both
came into being together; for were it not so, the
heart had not been made for love, nor love for
reflection.&#8217;</p>

<p>75 &nbsp; They asked the Fool: &#8216;Where did thy love
have its birth: in the secrets of the Beloved, or in
the revelation of them?&#8217; He replied: &#8216;Love in its
fullness makes no such distinction as this; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
secretly the Lover hides the secrets of his Beloved;
secretly also he reveals them, and yet when they
are revealed he keeps them secret still.&#8217;</p>

<p>76 &nbsp; The secrets of love, unrevealed, cause anguish
and grief; revelation of love brings fervour and fear.
And for this cause the Lover must ever be suffering.</p>

<p>77 &nbsp; Love called his lovers, and bade them ask of
him the most desirable and pleasing gifts. And
they asked of Love that he would clothe and adorn
them after his own manner, that they might be
more acceptable to the Beloved.</p>

<p>78 &nbsp; The Lover cried aloud to all men, and said:
&#8216;Love bids you ever love: in walking and sitting,
in sleeping and waking, in buying and selling, in
weeping and laughing, in speech and in silence, in
gain and in loss&mdash;in short, in whatsoever you do,
for this is Love&#8217;s commandment.&#8217;</p>

<p>79 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, Fool, when did Love first come to thee?&#8217;
&#8216;In that time,&#8217; he replied, &#8216;when my heart was
filled and enriched with thoughts and desires, sighs
and griefs, and my eyes with tears.&#8217; &#8216;And what did
Love bring thee?&#8217; &#8216;The wondrous ways of my
Beloved, His honours and His exceeding worth.&#8217;
&#8216;How did these things come?&#8217; &#8216;Through my
memory and understanding.&#8217; &#8216;How didst thou
receive them?&#8217; &#8216;With love and hope.&#8217; &#8216;How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
dost thou keep them?&#8217; &#8216;With justice and prudence,
temperance and courage.&#8217;</p>

<p>80 &nbsp; The Beloved sang, and said: &#8216;Little the Lover
knows of love, if he is ashamed to praise his Beloved,
or if he fears to do Him honour in that place where
He is most dishonoured; and little has he learned
to love who is impatient of tribulations; and he
who loses trust in his Beloved loses also his love
and hope.&#8217;</p>

<p>81 &nbsp; The Lover wrote to his Beloved, and asked Him
if there were others who could help him to suffer and
bear the grievous trials which he endured for love of
Him. And the Beloved replied to the Lover:
&#8216;There is nought in Me that can forsake nor fail
thee.&#8217;</p>

<p>82 &nbsp; They asked the Beloved concerning the love of
His Lover. He answered: &#8216;It is a mingling of joy
and sorrow, of fervency and fear.&#8217; They asked the
Lover concerning the love of his Beloved. And he
answered: &#8216;It is the inflowing of infinite goodness,
eternal life, power, wisdom, charity and perfection.
This is that which flows to the Lover from the
Beloved.&#8217;</p>

<p>83 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Fool, what meanest thou by a marvel?&#8217;
He replied: &#8216;It is a marvel to love things absent
more than things present; and no less to love things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
seen and things corruptible more than things unseen
and incorruptible.&#8217;</p>

<p>84 &nbsp; The Lover went to seek his Beloved, and he
found a man who was dying without love. And he
said: &#8216;How great a sadness is it that any man
should die without love!&#8217; So the Lover said to
him that was dying: &#8216;Say, why dost thou die
without love?&#8217; And he replied: &#8216;Because I lived
without love.&#8217;</p>

<p>85 &nbsp; The Lover asked his Beloved: &#8216;Which is the
greater&mdash;loving, or love itself?&#8217; The Beloved
answered: &#8216;In this mortal life, love is the tree, the
fruit of which is loving; the flowers and the leaves
are trials and griefs. And in God, love and loving
are one and the same thing, without either griefs
or trials.&#8217;</p>

<p>86 &nbsp; The Lover was sorrowful, and wearied with
overmuch thought. And therefore he begged his
Beloved to send him a book, in which he might
see Him in His virtues, that his sorrow might thereby
be relieved. So the Beloved sent that book to the
Lover, and his trials and griefs were doubled.</p>

<p>87 &nbsp; Sick with love was the Lover, and a physician
came in to see him who doubled his sorrows and his
thoughts. And in that same hour the Lover was
healed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>88 &nbsp; Love went apart with the Lover, and they had
great joy of the Beloved as they communed of Him.
The Lover wept, and afterwards was in rapture, and
Love swooned thereat. But the Beloved brought life
to His Lover by revealing to him His Countenance.</p>

<p>89 &nbsp; The Lover said to the Beloved: &#8216;By many
ways dost Thou come to my heart, and revealest
Thyself to my sight. And by many names do I
name Thee. But the love by which Thou sustainest
me and humblest me is one, and one alone.&#8217;</p>

<p>90 &nbsp; The Beloved revealed Himself to His Lover,
clothed in new and scarlet robes. He stretched out
His Arms to embrace him; He inclined His Head
to kiss him; and He remained on high that he
might ever seek Him.</p>

<p>91 &nbsp; The Beloved was absent from His Lover, and
the Lover sought his Beloved with his memory and
understanding, that he might worthily love Him.
The Lover found his Beloved, and asked Him
whither He had been. &#8216;Far from thy memory,&#8217;
answered the Beloved, &#8216;and in a place which thy
understanding knew not.&#8217;</p>

<p>92 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Fool, hast thou shame when men see
thee weep for thy Beloved?&#8217; &#8216;Shame apart from
sin,&#8217; answered the Lover, &#8216;signifies want of love in
one who knows not how to love.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>93 &nbsp; The Beloved planted in the heart of the Lover
sighs and longings, virtue and love. The Lover
watered the seed with his tears. In the body of the
Lover the Beloved planted trials, tribulations and
griefs. And the Lover tended his body with hope
and devotion, consolation and patience.</p>

<p>94 &nbsp; The Beloved made a great feast, gathered an
assembly of many noble knights, sent many invitations
and gave great gifts. To this assembly came
the Lover, and the Beloved said to him: &#8216;Who
called thee to come to this assembly?&#8217; The Lover
answered: &#8216;Need and love compelled me to come,
that I might behold Thy face, Thy wonders, Thy
adornments and Thy glory.&#8217;</p>

<p>95 &nbsp; They asked the Lover: &#8216;Whence art thou?&#8217;
He answered: &#8216;From love.&#8217; &#8216;To whom dost thou
belong?&#8217; &#8216;I belong to love.&#8217; &#8216;Who gave thee
birth?&#8217; &#8216;Love.&#8217; &#8216;Where wast thou born?&#8217;
&#8216;In love.&#8217; &#8216;Who brought thee up?&#8217; &#8216;Love.&#8217;
&#8216;How dost thou live?&#8217; &#8216;By love.&#8217; &#8216;What is
thy name?&#8217; &#8216;Love.&#8217; &#8216;Whence comest thou?&#8217;
&#8216;From love.&#8217; &#8216;Whither goest thou?&#8217; &#8216;To love.&#8217;
&#8216;Where dwelled thou?&#8217; &#8216;In love.&#8217; &#8216;Hast thou
aught but love?&#8217; &#8216;Yea,&#8217; he answered, &#8216;I have
faults; and I have sins against my Beloved.&#8217; &#8216;Is
there pardon in thy Beloved?&#8217; &#8216;Yea,&#8217; answered
the Lover, &#8216;in my Beloved there is justice and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
mercy, and therefore am I lodged between fear and
hope; for mercy causes me to hope and justice to
fear.&#8217;</p>

<p>96 &nbsp; The Beloved left the Lover, and the Lover
sought Him in his thoughts, and inquired for Him of
men in the language of love. The Lover found his
Beloved, who was despised among the people, and
he told the Beloved what great wrong was done to
His Name. The Beloved answered him, and said:
&#8216;Lo, I suffer these wrongs for want of fervent and
devoted lovers.&#8217; The Lover wept, and his sorrow
was increased, but the Beloved comforted him, by
revealing to him His Presence.</p>

<p>97 &nbsp; The light of the Beloved&#8217;s abode came to illumine
the Lover&#8217;s dwelling, which was full of
darkness, and to fill it with joy, with grief and with
thoughts. And the Lover cast out all things from
his dwelling, that the Beloved might be lodged there.</p>

<p>98 &nbsp; They asked the Lover what sign the Beloved
bore upon His banner. He replied: &#8216;The sign of
One dead.&#8217; They asked him why He bore such a
sign. He answered: &#8216;Because He was once crucified,
and was dead, and because those who glory in
being His lovers must follow His steps.&#8217;</p>

<p>99 &nbsp; The Beloved came to lodge in the dwelling of
His Lover, and the steward demanded of Him the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
reckoning. But the Lover said: &#8216;My Beloved is
to be lodged freely,&mdash;yea, with a gift,&mdash;for long ago
He paid the price of all men.&#8217;</p>

<p>100 &nbsp; Memory and Will met together, and climbed
into the mountain of the Beloved, that understanding
might be exalted and love for the Beloved might
be increased.</p>

<p>101 &nbsp; Every day sighs and tears are messengers
between the Lover and the Beloved, that between
them there may be solace and companionship, love
and goodwill.</p>

<p>102 &nbsp; The Lover desired his Beloved, and sent to
Him his thoughts, that they might bring him back
from his Beloved the joys which for so long had
been his.</p>

<p>103 &nbsp; The Beloved gave to His Lover the gift of
tears, sighs, thoughts, weariness and grief, with
which gift the Lover served his Beloved.</p>

<p>104 &nbsp; The Lover begged his Beloved to give him
riches, peace and honour in this world; and the
Beloved revealed His Countenance to the memory
and understanding of the Lover, and gave Himself
as the Supreme Aim to his will.</p>

<p>105 &nbsp; They asked the Lover: &#8216;In what consists
honour?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;In comprehending and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
loving my Beloved.&#8217; And they asked him also: &#8216;In
what consists dishonour?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;In forgetting
and ceasing to love Him.&#8217;</p>

<p>106 &nbsp; &#8216;O my Beloved, I was tormented by love,
until I cried that Thou wast present in my torments;
and then did love ease my griefs, and Thou as a
guerdon didst increase my love, even as Thou didst
double my torment.&#8217;</p>

<p>107 &nbsp; In the path of love the Lover found another
who was silent, and who with tears, grief, and a sad
countenance made accusation and reproach against
Love. And Love made excuse, saying that he had
given him noble gifts: loyalty, hope, patience,
devotion, courage, temperance and happiness; and
he blamed the Lover who cried out upon Love, for
that he had given him such gifts as these.</p>

<p>108 &nbsp; The Lover sang and said: &#8216;Ah, what great
affliction is love! Ah, what great happiness it is to
love my Beloved, who loves His lovers with infinite
and eternal love, perfect and complete in everything!&#8217;</p>

<p>109 &nbsp; The Lover went into a far country seeking his
Beloved, and in the way he met two lions. The
Lover was afraid, even to death, for he desired to
live and serve his Beloved. So he sent Memory to
his Beloved, that Love might be present at his passing,
for with Love he could better endure death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
And while the Lover thought upon his Beloved, the
two lions came humbly to the Lover, licked the
tears from his eyes, and caressed his hands and feet.
So the Lover went on his way in search of his
Beloved.</p>

<p>110 &nbsp; The Lover journeyed over hill and dale, but
he could find no way of escape from the imprisonment
in which Love had for so long enthralled his
body and his thoughts and all his desires and joys.
While the Lover went labouring thus, he found a
hermit who was sleeping near to a fair spring. The
Lover wakened the hermit, and asked him if in his
dreams he had seen the Beloved. The hermit
replied that his own thoughts also, whether he was
sleeping or waking, were imprisoned by Love. And
the Lover joyed greatly at finding a fellow-prisoner;
so they both wept, for the Beloved has few such
lovers as these.</p>

<p>111 &nbsp; There is naught in the Beloved which is not
care and sorrow for the Lover, nor has the Lover
aught in himself in which the Beloved joys not and
has no part. And therefore is the love of the
Beloved ever active, while that of the Lover is grief
and suffering.</p>

<p>112 &nbsp; A bird was singing upon a branch: &#8216;I will
give a fresh thought to the lover who will give me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
two.&#8217; The bird gave that fresh thought to the Lover,
and the Lover gave two to the bird, that its grief
might be assuaged; and the Lover felt his griefs
increased.</p>

<p>113 &nbsp; The Lover and the Beloved met together, and
their caresses and embraces, their weeping and
crying, bore witness to their meeting. Then the
Beloved asked the Lover concerning his state, and
the Lover was speechless before his Beloved.</p>

<p>114 &nbsp; The Lover and the Beloved strove, and their
love made peace between them. Which of them,
think you, bore the stronger love toward the other?</p>

<p>115 &nbsp; The Lover loved all who feared his Beloved,
and he feared all who feared Him not. And there
arose this doubt: Had the Lover more of love or of
fear?</p>

<p>116 &nbsp; The Lover thought to follow his Beloved, and
he passed along a road where there was a fierce lion
which killed all who passed by it carelessly and without
devotion. Then the Lover said: &#8216;He who
fears not my Beloved must fear everything, and he
who fears Him may be bold and fervent in all things
beside.&#8217;</p>

<p>117 &nbsp; They asked the Lover: &#8216;What meanest thou
by occasion of love?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;It is to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
pleasure in penance, understanding in knowledge,
hope in patience, health in abstinence, consolation
in remembrance, love in diligence, loyalty in destitution,
riches in poverty, peace in obedience,
strife in malevolence.&#8217;</p>

<p>118 &nbsp; Love shone through the cloud which came
between the Lover and the Beloved, and made it as
bright and resplendent as is the moon by night, as
the day-star at dawn, the sun at midday, the understanding
in the will; and through that bright cloud
the Lover and the Beloved held converse.</p>

<p>119 &nbsp; They asked the Lover: &#8216;What is the greatest
darkness?&#8217; He replied: &#8216;The absence of my
Beloved.&#8217; &#8216;And what is the greatest light?&#8217; &#8216;The
presence of my Beloved.&#8217;</p>

<p>120 &nbsp; The marks of the Beloved are seen in the
Lover, who for love&#8217;s sake is in thought and grief,
sighs and tears, and contempt of the people.</p>

<p>121 &nbsp; The Lover wrote these words: &#8216;My Beloved
delighteth because I raise my thoughts to Him, and
my eyes are in grief and tears, and I neither live nor
feel, nor taste nor see nor hear.&#8217;</p>

<p>122 &nbsp; Ah, understanding and will, cry out and
awaken the watchdogs who sleep, forgetting my
Beloved. Weep, O eyes! Sigh, O heart! And,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
memory, forget not the dishonour which is done
to my Beloved by those whom He has so greatly
honoured.</p>

<p>123 &nbsp; The enmity of men to my Beloved increases.
Yet my Beloved promises gifts and rewards,
and threatens with justice and wisdom. And
memory and will despise both His threats and
His promises.</p>

<p>124 &nbsp; The Beloved drew near to the Lover, to comfort
and console him for the grief which he suffered
and the tears which he shed. And the nearer was
the Lover to the Beloved, the more he grieved and
wept, crying out upon the dishonour which his
Beloved endured.</p>

<p>125 &nbsp; With the pen of love, with the water of his
tears, and on paper of suffering, the Lover wrote
letters to his Beloved. And in these he told how
devotion tarried, how love was dying, and how falsehood
and error were increasing the number of His
enemies.</p>

<p>126 &nbsp; The Lover and the Beloved were bound in love
with the bonds of memory, understanding, and will,
that they might never be parted; and the cord with
which these two loves were bound was woven of
thoughts and griefs, sighs and tears.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>127 &nbsp; The Lover lay in the bed of love: his sheets
were of joy, his coverlet was of griefs, his pillow of
tears. And none knew if the fabric of the pillow
was that of the sheets or of the coverlet.</p>

<p>128 &nbsp; The Beloved clothed His Lover in vest, coat
and mantle, and gave him a helmet of love. His
body He clothed with thoughts, his feet with tribulations,
and his head with a garland of tears.</p>

<p>129 &nbsp; The Beloved adjured His Lover not to forget
Him. The Lover replied that he could not forget Him
because he could not do otherwise than know Him.</p>

<p>130 &nbsp; The Beloved said to His Lover: &#8216;Thou shalt
praise and defend Me in places where men fear to
praise Me.&#8217; The Lover answered: &#8216;Provide me
then with love.&#8217; The Beloved answered: &#8216;For
love of thee I became incarnate, and endured the
pains of death.&#8217;</p>

<p>131 &nbsp; The Lover said to his Wellbeloved: &#8216;Teach
me how to make Thee known and loved and praised
among men.&#8217; The Beloved filled His Lover with
devotion, patience, charity, tribulations, thoughts,
sighs and tears. And boldness to praise the Beloved
entered the Lover&#8217;s heart; and in his mouth were
praises of his Beloved; and in his will was contempt
of the murmurings of men who judge falsely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>132 &nbsp; The Lover said to the people: &#8216;He who truly
remembers my Beloved, in remembering Him forgets
all things around; and he who forgets all things
in remembering my Beloved, is defended by Him
from all harm, and receives a part in all His
blessings.&#8217;</p>

<p>133 &nbsp; They asked the Lover: &#8216;Whereof is Love
born, whereon does it live, and wherefore does it
die?&#8217; The Lover answered: &#8216;Love is born of
remembrance, it lives on understanding, it dies
through forgetfulness.&#8217;</p>

<p>134 &nbsp; The Lover forgot all that was beneath the high
heavens that his understanding might soar the
higher towards a knowledge of the Beloved, whom
his will desired to comprehend, to contemplate,
praise and preach.</p>

<p>135 &nbsp; The Lover went to the wars for the honour of
his Beloved, and took with him faith, hope and
charity, justice, prudence, strength and temperance
with which to vanquish his Beloved&#8217;s enemies. And
the Lover would have been vanquished if the Beloved
had not helped him to make known His greatness.</p>

<p>136 &nbsp; The Lover desired to attain to the farthest
goal of his love for the Beloved; and other objects
blocked his path. For this cause his longing desires
and thoughts gave the Lover sorrow and grief.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>137 &nbsp; The Lover was glad, and rejoiced in the greatness
of his Beloved. But afterwards the Lover was
sad because of overmuch thought and reflection.
And he knew not which he felt the more deeply&mdash;the
joys or the sorrows.</p>

<p>138 &nbsp; The Lover was sent by his Beloved to Christian
princes and to unbelievers, to teach them by his
<i>Art</i><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and his <i>Elements</i><a name="FNanchor_5a_5a" id="FNanchor_5a_5a"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> to know and love his
Beloved.</p>

<p>139 &nbsp; If thou seest a lover clothed in fine raiment,
prizing vainglory, sated with food and sleep, know
that in that man thou seest damnation and torment.
And if thou seest a lover poorly clothed, despised by
the world, pale and thin with fast and vigil, know
that in that man thou lookest upon salvation and
everlasting weal.</p>

<p>140 &nbsp; The Lover made complaint to his Beloved of
the heat of the fire which raged in his breast. The
Lover was like to die, and the Beloved wept, and
gave him the comfort of patience and the sure hope
of reward.</p>

<p>141 &nbsp; The Lover wept for all that he had lost; and
none could comfort him, for his losses could not be
regained.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>142 &nbsp; God created the night that men might keep
vigil, and meditate upon the glories of the Beloved:
there was a time when the Lover thought that it was
created for the rest and sleep of those who were
wearied with loving.</p>

<p>143 &nbsp; Men reproached and reproved the Lover,
because he went about as a fool for love&#8217;s sake. And
the Lover despised their reproaches, and himself
reproved them, because they loved not his Beloved.</p>

<p>144 &nbsp; The Lover said: &#8216;I am clothed in vile raiment;
but love clothes my heart with thoughts of delight,
and my body with tears, griefs and sufferings.&#8217;</p>

<p>145 &nbsp; The Beloved sang, and said: &#8216;I taught those
who praise Me to sing My praises aright, and the
enemies of My honour have tormented and despised
them. Therefore have I sent my Lover that he may
weep and lament the dishonour which I have
suffered, and his laments and tears are the fruit of
My love.&#8217;</p>

<p>146 &nbsp; The Lover made oath to the Beloved that for
love of Him he endured and loved trials and sufferings,
and he begged the Beloved that He would
think upon his trials and sufferings. The Beloved
made oath that it was the nature and property of His
love to love all those that loved Him, and to have
pity on those who endured trials for love of Him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
The Lover was glad, and rejoiced in the nature and
property of his Beloved.</p>

<p>147 &nbsp; The Beloved silenced His Lover, and the
Lover took comfort in gazing upon his Beloved.</p>

<p>148 &nbsp; The Lover wept and called upon his Beloved,
until the Beloved came down from the heights of
Heaven; and He came to earth to weep and suffer
and die for the sake of love, and to teach men to
know and love and praise His Name.</p>

<p>149 &nbsp; The Lover reproached Christian people, because
in their letters they put not first the name of
his Beloved, Jesus Christ, to do Him the same honour
that the Saracens do to the false prophet Mahomet,
when they honour him by naming him before everything
in their letters.</p>

<p>150 &nbsp; The Lover met a Squire, pale, thin, and poorly
clothed, who was walking along in pensive fashion;
and he saluted the Lover and said: &#8216;Now God
guide thee, that thou mayest find thy Beloved!&#8217;
And the Lover asked him how he had recognised
him; and the Squire said: &#8216;Some of Love&#8217;s secrets
reveal others, and therefore between lovers there is
recognition.&#8217;</p>

<p>151 &nbsp; The glory, honour and goodness of the Beloved
are the riches and treasure of the Lover. And the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Beloved&#8217;s treasure is the store of thoughts, desires,
torments, tears and griefs with which the Lover ever
loves and honours his Beloved.</p>

<p>152 &nbsp; A great and goodly company of tried lovers
have gathered together; they bear the banner of love,
on which is the form and figure of their Beloved.
And they will have with them none who has not
love, lest their Beloved should be dishonoured.</p>

<p>153 &nbsp; They who show their folly by heaping up
riches move the Lover to be a fool for love; and
the shame which the Lover feels at going as a fool
among men makes him to be esteemed and loved.
Which of the two emotions, think you, is the greater
occasion of love?</p>

<p>154 &nbsp; Love made the Lover to be sad through excess
of thought; the Beloved sang, and the Lover rejoiced
to hear Him. Which of these two causes,
think you, increased more the Lover&#8217;s love?</p>

<p>155 &nbsp; In the secrets of the Lover are revealed the
secrets of the Beloved, and in the secrets of the
Beloved are revealed the secrets of the Lover. Which
of these two secrets, think you, is the greater cause
of revelation?</p>

<p>156 &nbsp; They asked the Fool by what signs his Beloved
might be known. He answered: &#8216;By mercy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
pity, which are essentially in His Will, without
mutation or change.&#8217;</p>

<p>157 &nbsp; Such was the love which the Lover had to
his Beloved, that he desired the good of all above
the good of each, and for his Beloved to be everywhere
known and praised, and desired of all the
world.</p>

<p>158 &nbsp; Love and Indifference met in a garden, where
the Lover and the Beloved were talking in secret.
And Love asked Indifference why he had come to
that place. &#8216;That the Lover may cease to love,&#8217; he
replied, &#8216;and the Beloved to be honoured.&#8217; The
words of Indifference were greatly displeasing to
the Beloved and the Lover, and their love was increased,
that Indifference might be vanquished and
destroyed thereby.</p>

<p>159 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Fool, in which dost thou take the
greater pleasure&mdash;in loving or in hating?&#8217; &#8216;In
loving,&#8217; he replied, &#8216;for I have only hated that I may
the better love.&#8217;</p>

<p>160 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Lover, which dost thou strive to
understand the better&mdash;falsehood or truth?&#8217; He
answered: &#8216;Truth.&#8217; &#8216;And why so?&#8217; &#8216;Because I
understand falsehood that I may the better understand
truth.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>161 &nbsp; The Lover perceived that he was loved by his
Beloved, and he inquired of Him if His love and
His mercy were one and the same thing. The
Beloved affirmed that in His essence there was no
distinction between His love and His mercy. Therefore
said the Lover: &#8216;Why, then, does Thy love
torment me, and why does not Thy mercy heal me
of my griefs?&#8217;</p>

<p>162 &nbsp; The Lover desired to go into a far country to
do honour to his Beloved, and he wished to disguise
himself that he might not be taken captive on the
way; but he could not hide the tears in his eyes, nor his
pale and drawn face, nor the thoughts, complaints
and sighs, the sorrow and grief of his heart. And so
he was taken captive on the journey and delivered
to the tormentors by the enemies of his Beloved.</p>

<p>163 &nbsp; Imprisoned was the Lover in the prison of
Love. Thoughts, desires and memories held and
enchained him lest he might flee from his Beloved.
Griefs tormented him; patience and hope consoled
him. And the Lover was dying, but the Beloved
revealed to him His Presence, and the Lover revived.</p>

<p>164 &nbsp; The Lover met his Beloved, and he knew Him
and wept. The Beloved reproved him, because he
wept not until he knew Him. &#8216;How didst thou
know Me,&#8217; He asked, &#8216;since thine eyes were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
already wet with tears?&#8217; And the Lover answered:
&#8216;By memory, understanding and will, through which,
as soon as the eyes of my body saw Thee, my love
was increased.&#8217;</p>

<p>165 &nbsp; &#8216;What meanest thou by love?&#8217; said the
Beloved. And the Lover answered: &#8216;It is to bear
on one&#8217;s heart the sacred marks and the sweet words
of the Beloved. It is to long for Him with desire
and with tears. It is boldness. It is fervour. It
is fear. It is the desire for the Beloved above all
things. It is that which causes the Lover to grow
faint when he hears the Beloved&#8217;s praises. It is
that in which I die daily, and in which is all my will.&#8217;</p>

<p>166 &nbsp; Devotion and Absent Longing sent thoughts
as messengers to the Lover&#8217;s heart, to bring tears to
his eyes, which for long had wept but now would
weep no more.</p>

<p>167 &nbsp; Said the Lover: &#8216;O ye that love, if ye will
have fire, come light your lanterns at my heart; if
water, come to my eyes, whence flow the tears in
streams; if thoughts of love, come gather them
from my meditations.&#8217;</p>

<p>168 &nbsp; It happened one day that the Lover was meditating
on the great love which he had for his Beloved,
and the great trials and perils into which this love
for so long had led him, and he fell to considering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
his reward, which, he said, would surely be great.
And as he thus discoursed with himself, it came to
him that his Beloved had recompensed him already,
for had he not been inspired with a love for His
Presence,&mdash;with that very love through which his
sufferings had come?</p>

<p>169 &nbsp; The Lover was wiping away the tears which
for Love&#8217;s sake he had shed, that none should see
the sufferings which the Beloved sent him. But
the Beloved said: &#8216;Why wouldst thou hide from
others these marks of thy love? Behold, I have
given them to thee that others may love and honour
Me also.&#8217;</p>

<p>170 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O thou that goest as a fool for love&#8217;s sake,
how long wilt thou be a slave, and forced to weep
and suffer trials and griefs?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;Till
my Beloved shall separate body and soul in me.&#8217;</p>

<p>171 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Fool, hast thou riches?&#8217; He
answered: &#8216;I have my Beloved.&#8217; &#8216;Hast thou
villas, castles or cities, provinces or kingdoms?&#8217;
He answered: &#8216;I have thoughts of love, tears, desires,
trials, griefs, which are better than kingdoms
or empires.&#8217;</p>

<p>172 &nbsp; They asked the Lover: &#8216;How knowest thou
the justice of thy Beloved&#8217;s decrees?&#8217; He answered:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
&#8216;In that He allots to his lovers an equality of joys
and of griefs.&#8217;</p>

<p>173 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Fool, which of these knows the more
of love&mdash;he that has joys or he that has trials and
griefs?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;There can be no knowledge
of love without both the one and the other.&#8217;</p>

<p>174 &nbsp; They asked the Lover: &#8216;Why wilt thou not
defend thyself from the falsehoods, errors and
crimes of which thou art accused?&#8217; He answered
and said: &#8216;I have to defend my Beloved, whom
men falsely accuse; man may indeed be full of deceit
and error, and is scarce worthy to be defended.&#8217;</p>

<p>175 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Fool, why defended thou Love when
it thus tries and torments thy body and thy soul?&#8217;
He answered: &#8216;Because it increases my worth and
my happiness.&#8217;</p>

<p>176 &nbsp; The Lover grieved and cried out on his
Beloved, because He caused Love to torment him
so grievously. And the Beloved made reply by
increasing his trials and perils, thoughts and tears.</p>

<p>177 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Fool, why dost thou excuse the
guilty?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;That I may not be like
those who accuse the innocent with the guilty.&#8217;</p>

<p>178 &nbsp; The Beloved raised the understanding of the
Lover that he might comprehend His greatness, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
incline his memory to recall his own shortcomings,
so that his will might hate them, and aspire to a love
of the Beloved and His perfection.</p>

<p>179 &nbsp; The Lover sang of his Beloved and said: &#8216;So
great is my will to love Thee, that all I hated once
is now, through love of Thee, a greater happiness
and joy to me than what I once loved before ever I
loved Thee.&#8217;</p>

<p>180 &nbsp; The Lover went through a city, and asked
if there were none with whom he might speak of
his Beloved as he wished. And they showed
him a poor man who was weeping for love,
and who sought a companion with whom to speak
of love.</p>

<p>181 &nbsp; Thoughtful and perplexed was the Lover, as
he wondered how his trials could have their source
in the glory of his Beloved, who has such great
felicity in Himself. And then he thought of the
sun, which, though it is so high, strikes the weak
eyes of us men that are here below.</p>

<p>182 &nbsp; The thoughts of the Lover were between
forgetfulness of his torments and remembrance of
his joys; for the joys of love drive the memory of
sorrow away, and the tortures of love recall the
happiness which it brings.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>183 &nbsp; They asked the Lover: &#8216;Will thy Beloved
ever take away thy love?&#8217; And he answered: &#8216;No,
not while memory has power to remember, nor
understanding to comprehend the Beloved&#8217;s glory.&#8217;</p>

<p>184 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Fool, what is the greatest comparison
and similitude of all that can be made?&#8217; He
answered: &#8216;That between Lover and Beloved.&#8217;
They asked him: &#8216;For what reason?&#8217; He replied:
&#8216;For the greatness of their love.&#8217;</p>

<p>185 &nbsp; They asked the Beloved: &#8216;Hast Thou never
had pity?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;If I had not had pity,
my Lover had never learned to love Me, nor had I
tormented him with sighs and tears, with trials and
with griefs.&#8217;</p>

<p>186 &nbsp; The Lover was in a vast forest, seeking his
Beloved. He found there Truth and Falsehood, who
were disputing of his Beloved, for Truth praised Him
and Falsehood accused Him. And the Lover cried
out to Love that he would come to the aid of Truth.</p>

<p>187 &nbsp; There came the temptation to the Lover to
leave his Beloved, that memory might awaken and
find the Beloved&#8217;s Presence once more; that his
love should thereby become deeper, that the understanding
should comprehend Him more sublimely,
and the will love Him more truly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>188 &nbsp; For one day the Lover ceased to remember
his Beloved, and on the next day he remembered
that he had forgotten Him. On the day when it
came to the Lover that he had forgotten his Beloved,
he was in sorrow and pain, and yet in glory and bliss,&mdash;the
one for having forgotten Him, and the other
for the joy of the remembrance.</p>

<p>189 &nbsp; So earnestly did the Lover desire that his
Beloved should be honoured and praised, that he
doubted if he honoured Him enough; and so
strongly did he abhor the dishonour paid to his
Beloved, that he doubted if he abhorred it enough.
And for this cause the Lover was thoughtful, and
wavered between love and fear.</p>

<p>190 &nbsp; The Lover was like to die of joy, and he lived
by grief. And his joys and torments were mingled
and united, and became one and the same thing in
the Lover&#8217;s will. And for this cause the Lover
seemed to be living and dying at one and the same
time.</p>

<p>191 &nbsp; For one hour only the Lover would fain have
forgotten his Beloved, and known Him not, that his
grief might have some rest. But such oblivion and
ignorance had themselves made him to suffer; therefore
he had patience, and lifted up his understanding
and his memory, in contemplation of his Beloved.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>192 &nbsp; So great was the love of the Lover to his
Beloved that he believed all things that He revealed
to him. And so earnestly did he desire to comprehend
Him that he strove with his reason to
understand all things that were said of Him. And
therefore was the love of the Lover for ever between
belief and understanding.</p>

<p>193 &nbsp; They asked the Lover: &#8216;What thing is
farthest from thy heart?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;Indifference.&#8217;
&#8216;And why so?&#8217; &#8216;Because nearest to my
heart is love, which is the contrary of indifference.&#8217;</p>

<p>194 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Fool, hast thou envy?&#8217; He answered:
&#8216;Yea, whensoever I forget the bounty and riches of
my Beloved.&#8217;</p>

<p>195 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Lover, hast thou riches?&#8217; &#8216;Yea,&#8217;
he replied, &#8216;I have love.&#8217; &#8216;Hast thou poverty?&#8217;
&#8216;Yea, I have love.&#8217; &#8216;How then is this?&#8217; &#8216;I am
poor,&#8217; he replied, &#8216;because my love is no greater,
and because it fills so few others with love for the
honour of my Beloved.&#8217;</p>

<p>196 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Lover, where is thy power?&#8217; He
answered: &#8216;In the power of my Beloved.&#8217; &#8216;Wherewith
dost thou fight thine enemies?&#8217; &#8216;With the
strength of my Beloved.&#8217; &#8216;Wherein dost thou seek
consolation?&#8217; &#8216;In the eternal treasures of my
Beloved.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>197 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Fool, which lovest thou the more&mdash;the
mercy or the justice of thy Beloved?&#8217; He
answered: &#8216;So greatly do I love and fear His justice
that I find it not in my will to love anything more.&#8217;</p>

<p>198 &nbsp; Sins and merits were striving among themselves
in the Lover&#8217;s conscience. Justice and remembrance
increased his remorse, but mercy and
hope increased in his will the assurance of pardon;
and therefore in the Lover&#8217;s penitence the merits
conquered the sins.</p>

<p>199 &nbsp; The Lover affirmed that all was perfection in
his Beloved, and denied that in Him was any fault
at all. Which of these two, think you, is the greater
wonder?</p>

<p>200 &nbsp; There was an eclipse in the heavens and darkness
over all the earth. And it recalled to the Lover
that his guilt had separated him long ago from his
Wellbeloved and the darkness had banished the
light from his understanding. This is that light by
which the Beloved reveals Himself to His lovers.</p>

<p>201 &nbsp; Love came to the Lover, who asked him:
&#8216;What wilt thou?&#8217; And Love replied: &#8216;I have
come to thee that I may nurture and direct thy life,
so that at thy death thou shalt be able through my
aid to vanquish thy mortal enemies.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>202 &nbsp; When the Lover forgot his Beloved, Love fell
sick; and when he gave himself to overmuch thinking,
he himself fell sick, and his Beloved gave him
trials, griefs and cares.</p>

<p>203 &nbsp; The Lover found a man who was dying without
love. And the Lover wept that a man should
die without love, for the dishonour which it brought
to his Beloved. So he asked that man: &#8216;Why dost
thou die without love?&#8217; And he answered: &#8216;There
is none who will give me knowledge of love, or teach
me to be a lover.&#8217; So the Lover sighed and wept,
and said: &#8216;Ah, devotion, when wilt thou be great
enough to drive away sin, and to win for my Beloved
many fervent and ardent lovers who will never
shrink from praising His Name?&#8217;</p>

<p>204 &nbsp; The Lover tempted Love to see if he would
remain in his heart though he remembered not his
Beloved; and his heart ceased to think and his eyes to
weep. So his love vanished, and the Lover was perplexed.
And he asked all men if they had seen Love.</p>

<p>205 &nbsp; Love and loving, Lover and Beloved are so
straitly united in the Beloved that they are of His
Essence, and are one. And this though Lover and
Beloved are entities distinct, which agree without
diversity of essence. So the Beloved is to be loved
above all other objects of affection.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>206 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Fool, wherefore hast thou so great
love?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;Because long and perilous
is the journey which I make in search of my Beloved,
and I must seek Him with great faith, and journey
with all speed. And none of these things can be
accomplished without great love.&#8217;</p>

<p>207 &nbsp; The Lover watched and fasted, wept, gave
alms, and travelled afar that the Will of the Beloved
might be moved to inspire His subjects with love to
honour His Name; but the Lover considered that
water does not by nature grow hot, nor mount on
high, unless it be first heated. Therefore he prayed
the Beloved that He would deign first to warm him
in his journeys, alms and vigils with the heat of love,
that he might accomplish his desires.</p>

<p>208 &nbsp; The Lover met a pilgrim who sang: &#8216;If the
love of the Lover suffices not to move his Beloved
to pity and pardon, the love of the Beloved is sufficient
to give graces and blessings to His creatures.&#8217;</p>

<p>209 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Fool, how canst thou be most like to
thy Beloved?&#8217; He replied: &#8216;By comprehending
and loving with all my power the beauties and the
perfections of my Beloved.&#8217;</p>

<p>210 &nbsp; They asked the Lover if his Beloved had need
of aught. &#8216;Yea,&#8217; he answered, &#8216;of those who will
love and praise Him, and extol His surpassing worth.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>211 &nbsp; The Beloved chastened His Lover&#8217;s heart with
rods of love, to make him love the tree whence He
plucks the rods wherewith He chastens His lovers.
And this is that tree on which He suffered grief,
dishonour and death, that He might bring back to
love of Him those lovers whom He had lost.</p>

<p>212 &nbsp; The Lover met his Beloved, who appeared
in power and glory, as One worthy of all honour.
And he cried: &#8216;How strange a thing it is that so
few among men revere and know and love Thee as
Thou deservest!&#8217; And the Beloved answered him
and said: &#8216;Greatly has man grieved Me; for I
created him to revere Me, know Me and love Me,
and now, of every thousand, but a hundred fear
and love Me; and ninety of these hundred fear Me
by reason of the pains of hell, and ten love Me for
the sake of the glory hereafter; hardly is there one
who loves Me for My goodness and nobility.&#8217; When
the Lover heard these words, he wept bitterly for
the dishonour paid to his Beloved; and he said:
&#8216;Ah, my Beloved, how much hast Thou given to
man and how greatly hast Thou honoured him!
Why then has man thus forgotten Thee?&#8217;</p>

<p>213 &nbsp; The Lover was praising his Beloved, and he
said that He was transcendent because He is in a
place where place is not. And therefore, when they
asked the Lover where his Beloved was, he replied:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
&#8216;He is, but I know not where; I only know that my
Beloved is in my remembrance.&#8217;</p>

<p>214 &nbsp; The Beloved bought a slave that He might
show him His graces, and made him to suffer griefs
and heavy thoughts, sighs and tears. And He asked
him: &#8216;What wilt thou eat and drink?&#8217; The slave
replied: &#8216;What Thou wilt.&#8217; &#8216;But what wilt thou?&#8217;
&#8216;My will is as Thine.&#8217; &#8216;Hast thou then no will?&#8217;
asked the Beloved. He answered: &#8216;A subject and a
slave has no other will than to obey his Lord and
his Beloved.&#8217;</p>

<p>215 &nbsp; The Beloved inquired of His Lover if he had
patience. He answered: &#8216;All things please me, and
therefore I cannot but be patient, for he who is no
more lord of his will can not be impatient.&#8217;</p>

<p>216 &nbsp; Love gave himself to any who would receive
him; and since he gave himself to few and inspired
few with love, as he was free and had not been
constrained, therefore the Lover cried out on Love,
and accused him before the Beloved. But Love
made his defence and said: &#8216;I strive not against
free will, for I desire all lovers to have the greatest
merit and glory.&#8217;</p>

<p>217 &nbsp; There was great strife and contention between
Love and the Lover, because the Lover was incensed
at the trials which Love made him to bear. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
they debated whether Love or the Lover was to
blame. So both of them came to the judgment-seat
of the Beloved; and He chastened the Lover
with griefs and rewarded him with increase of love.</p>

<p>218 &nbsp; There was a contention whether Love has
more of thought than of patience. And the Lover
resolved the contention, saying that Love is born of
thought and nourished with patience.</p>

<p>219 &nbsp; The Lover has for neighbours the perfections
of the Beloved; and the Beloved&#8217;s neighbours are
the thoughts of the Lover, and the trials and tears
which Love gives him to bear.</p>

<p>220 &nbsp; The Lover&#8217;s will loved to soar on high, that he
might have great love toward his Beloved; so he
commanded the understanding to soar as high as it
might; and the understanding commanded the
memory, so that all three mounted to the contemplation
of the Beloved&#8217;s glories.</p>

<p>221 &nbsp; The will of the Lover left him and flew to the
Beloved. And the Beloved gave it into the captivity
of the Lover, that he might use it to love and
serve Him.</p>

<p>222 &nbsp; The Lover said: &#8216;O let not my Beloved think
that I have left Him to love another, for my love has
united me to One, and to One alone.&#8217; The Beloved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
answered and said: &#8216;Let not My Lover think that
I am loved and served by him alone; for I have
many lovers who have loved Me more fervently and
for longer than he.&#8217;</p>

<p>223 &nbsp; Said the Lover to his Beloved: &#8216;O my
Beloved, that art worthy of all love, Thou hast
taught and accustomed my eyes to see and my ears
to hear Thy wonders. And these have inspired
thoughts which have brought tears to my eyes and
griefs to my heart.&#8217; The Beloved answered the
Lover: &#8216;Had I not taught and guided thee so, thy
name had not been written in the book of those who
shall come to eternal bliss, from which are wiped
out the names of such as shall go to eternal punishment.&#8217;</p>

<p>224 &nbsp; In the heart of the Lover gathered the glories
and beauties of the Beloved, increasing his thoughts
and griefs, so that he had altogether died if the
Beloved had increased in him any further the
thoughts of His greatness.</p>

<p>225 &nbsp; The Beloved came to sojourn in the hostelry
of the Lover; and His Lover made Him a bed of
thoughts, and there served Him sighs and tears;
and the Beloved paid His reckoning with memories.</p>

<p>226 &nbsp; Love put joys and trials together into the
Lover&#8217;s thoughts, and the joys made complaint of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
that company and accused Love before the Beloved.
But when He had parted them from the sorrows
which Love gives to his lovers, behold, they
vanished and were gone.</p>

<p>227 &nbsp; The marks of the love which the Lover has to
his Beloved are, in the beginning, tears; then,
tribulations; and, in the end, death. And with
those marks did the Lover preach before the lovers
of his Beloved.</p>

<p>228 &nbsp; The Lover went into solitude; and his heart
was accompanied by thoughts, his eyes by tears, and
his body by fasts and afflictions. But when the
Lover returned to the companionship of men, these
things went no longer with him, and the Lover
remained quite alone in the company of many
people.</p>

<p>229 &nbsp; Love is an ocean, its waves troubled by the
winds; it has no port or shore. The Lover
perished in this ocean, and with him perished his
trials, and the work of his fulfilment began.</p>

<p>230 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Fool, what is love?&#8217; He answered:
&#8216;Love is a working together of thought and action
towards one end, to which in like manner the
Lover&#8217;s will also moves; and this is the end, that
men may serve and honour his Beloved.&#8217; Think
you now that the Lover&#8217;s will is in truer harmony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
with this end when he longs to be with his Beloved,
or when he longs to convert to Him many lovers?</p>

<p>231 &nbsp; They asked the Lover: &#8216;Who is thy Beloved?&#8217;
He answered: &#8216;He who makes me to
love, desire, pine, weep, sigh and suffer, and die.&#8217;</p>

<p>232 &nbsp; They asked the Beloved: &#8216;Who is Thy
Lover?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;He who fears naught so
that he may honour and praise My Name, and who
renounces all things to obey My commandments and
counsels.&#8217;</p>

<p>233&nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Fool, which is the heavier and more
grievous burden&mdash;the trials of love, or the trials of
those that love not?&#8217; And he answered: &#8216;Go,
ask it of those who do penance for the love of their
Beloved, and of those who do penance from fear of
the pains of hell.&#8217;</p>

<p>234 &nbsp; The Lover slept, and Love died, for he had
naught whereby to live. The Lover wakened, and
Love revived in the thoughts which the Lover sent
to his Beloved.</p>

<p>235 &nbsp; The Lover said: &#8216;The infused science comes
from the will, from prayer and devotion; and
acquired science comes from study and understanding.&#8217;
Which of the two, then, think you, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
more proper and more pleasing to the Lover, and
which possesses he the more perfectly?</p>

<p>236 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Fool, whence hast thou thy needs?&#8217;
He answered: &#8216;From thoughts, from longing, from
adoration, from trials and from perseverance.&#8217;
&#8216;And whence hast thou all these things?&#8217; He
answered: &#8216;From love.&#8217; &#8216;And whence hast thou
thy Beloved?&#8217; &#8216;From Himself alone.&#8217;</p>

<p>237 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Fool, wilt thou be free of all things?&#8217;
He answered: &#8216;Yea, save only of my Beloved.&#8217;
&#8216;Wilt thou be a prisoner?&#8217; &#8216;Yea, of sighs and
tears, thoughts and trials, dangers and exiles, that
I may serve my Beloved, for to praise His exceeding
worthiness was I created.&#8217;</p>

<p>238 &nbsp; Love tormented the Lover, for which cause
he lamented and wept. His Beloved called him to
come to Him, and be healed; and the nearer came
the Lover to his Beloved, the more grievously did
love afflict him; and the more he felt of love and
grief, the more he loved, and the more perfectly
did the Beloved heal him of his sickness.</p>

<p>239 &nbsp; Love fell sick, and the Lover tended him with
patience, perseverance, obedience and hope. Love
grew well, and the Lover fell sick; and he was cured
by his Beloved, who made him to remember His
virtue and honour.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>240 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Fool, what is solitude?&#8217; He
answered: &#8216;It is solace and companionship between
Lover and Beloved.&#8217; &#8216;And what are solace
and companionship?&#8217; &#8216;Solitude in the Lover&#8217;s
heart, when he remembers naught save his
Beloved.&#8217;</p>

<p>241 &nbsp; They asked the Lover: &#8216;In which is there
greater danger, in bearing trials for love&#8217;s sake or
in enjoying pleasures?&#8217; The Lover took counsel
with his Beloved, and replied: &#8216;The perils which
come through pleasures are the perils of ignorance;
and those which come through afflictions are the
perils of impatience.&#8217;</p>

<p>242 &nbsp; The Beloved gave Love his freedom, and
allowed men to take him to themselves as much as
they would; but scarce one was found who would
take him to his heart. And for this cause the Lover
wept, and was sad at the dishonour which is paid to
Love by the ungrateful among men and by false
lovers.</p>

<p>243 &nbsp; Love destroyed all that was in the heart of his
faithful Lover that he might live and have free
course in it; and the Lover would have died had
memory not revealed to him his Beloved.</p>

<p>244 &nbsp; On two things the Lover was wont to meditate:
the one was the Essence and the goodness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
his Beloved, and the other was his Beloved&#8217;s works.
He knew not which of these was the more excellent
and the more pleasing to the Beloved.</p>

<p>245 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Fool, wouldst thou fain die?&#8217; He
answered: &#8216;Yea, to the pleasures of this world and
the thoughts of the unhappy sinners who dishonour
and forget my Beloved; in whose thoughts I would
have no part nor lot, since my Beloved has no part in
them.&#8217;</p>

<p>246 &nbsp; &#8216;If thou speakest truth, O Fool, thou wilt be
beaten by men, tormented, mocked, reproved and
killed.&#8217; He answered: &#8216;From those words it
follows that if I spoke falsehoods I should be praised
by men, served, loved and honoured, and defended
by those who despise my Beloved.&#8217;</p>

<p>247 &nbsp; False flatterers were speaking ill of the Lover
one day in the presence of his Beloved. The Lover
was patient, and the Beloved shewed His justice,
wisdom and power. And the Lover preferred to
be blamed and reproved in this wise, than to be one
of those that falsely accused him.</p>

<p>248 &nbsp; The Beloved planted many seeds in the heart
of His Lover, but one of them only took life and put
forth leaf and gave flower and fruit. Think you
that from this single fruit may come many seeds?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>249 &nbsp; Far above Love is the Beloved; far beneath it
is the Lover; and Love, which lies between these
two, made the Beloved to descend to the Lover,
and the Lover to rise toward the Beloved. And this
ascending and descending is the being and the life
of Love&mdash;of that Love which makes the Lover to
endure pain and which ever serves the Beloved.</p>

<p>250 &nbsp; On the right side of Love stands the Beloved,
and on the left side is the Lover; and thus he
cannot reach the Beloved unless he pass through
Love. And before Love stands the Beloved, and
beyond is the Lover; so that the Lover cannot
reach Love unless his thoughts and desires have
first passed through the Beloved.</p>

<p>251 &nbsp; The Beloved clothed Himself in the garment
of His Lover, that he might be His companion in
glory for ever. So the Lover desired to wear
crimson garments daily, that his dress might be like
that of his Beloved.</p>

<p>252 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Fool, what did thy Beloved before the
world was?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;My Beloved loved,
because of His manifold properties, eternal, personal,
and infinite, in which are Lover, Love and Beloved.&#8217;</p>

<p>253 &nbsp; The Lover wept and was sad, when he saw
how the unbelievers were losing his Beloved
through ignorance; but he rejoiced in the justice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
of his Beloved, who punishes those that know Him
and are disobedient. Which, think you, was greater,
his sorrow or his joy? And was his joy greater
when he saw his Beloved honoured than his sorrow
at seeing Him despised?</p>

<p>254 &nbsp; The Lover contemplated his Beloved in all
the variety and harmony of His virtues; and again
in the contrariety between virtue and vice; and
again in His Being and perfection, which have
greater harmony between themselves than non-existence
and imperfection.</p>

<p>255 &nbsp; The variety and harmony which the Lover
found in the Beloved revealed to him His secrets,
to wit, His plurality and unity, to the greater concordance
of essence without contrariety.</p>

<p>256 &nbsp; They said to the Lover: &#8216;Corruption is contrary
to being, as generation, which is opposed to it,
is the contrary of non-existence. If it were eternally
corrupting and corrupted, it would be impossible
that non-existence or end should harmonise with
corruption.&#8217; By these words the Lover saw in his
Beloved the principle of eternal generation.</p>

<p>257 &nbsp; If that which increases the love of the Lover
for his Beloved were falseness, that which diminished
it would be truth. And if this were so,
it would follow that there would be a want of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
great and the true in the Beloved, and that there
would be harmony in Him between the false and the
mean.</p>

<p>258 &nbsp; The Lover praised his Beloved, and said that
if in Him were the greatest degree of perfection and
the greatest possible freedom from imperfection,
his Beloved must be simple, pure and present in
essence and operation. And while the Lover
praised his Beloved thus, there was revealed to him
the Trinity of his Beloved.</p>

<p>259 &nbsp; In the numbers 1 and 3 the Lover found
greater harmony than between any others, because
by these numbers every bodily form passed to
existence from non-existence. And the greatest
harmony of number, the Lover thought, was in the
Unity and the Trinity of his Beloved.</p>

<p>260 &nbsp; The Lover extolled the power, the wisdom
and the will of his Beloved, who had created all
things, save only sin; so that, but for His power
and wisdom and will, had nothing existed. And
neither the power, the wisdom nor the will of the
Beloved are an occasion of sin.</p>

<p>261 &nbsp; The Lover praised and loved his Beloved, for
He had created him and given him all things; and
he praised and loved Him too because it pleased
Him to take his form and nature. And it may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
asked, Which had more of perfection, his praise or
his love?</p>

<p>262 &nbsp; Love tempted the wisdom of the Lover, and
asked him whether the Beloved showed the greater
love in taking his nature, or in redeeming him.
And the Lover was perplexed, and replied at last
that redemption was destined to put away unhappiness,
and the Incarnation to bring about
bliss. And this reply provoked the question again:
&#8216;Which was the greater love?&#8217;</p>

<p>263 &nbsp; The Lover went from door to door asking
alms to keep in mind the love of his Beloved for His
servants, and to practise the virtues of poverty,
humility and patience, which are well-pleasing to
the Beloved.</p>

<p>264 &nbsp; They asked pardon of the Lover, for the love
of his Beloved; and the Lover not only pardoned
them but gave them himself and his goods.</p>

<p>265 &nbsp; With tears in his eyes the Lover described
the Passion and the pains which his Beloved bore
for love of him; and with sad and heavy thoughts
he wrote down the words which He uttered; and
by mercy and hope he was comforted.</p>

<p>266 &nbsp; The Beloved taught His Lover how to love;
and Love intruded him in speech; and Patience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
to bear afflictions for the love of Him to whom he
had given himself to be a servant.</p>

<p>267 &nbsp; The Beloved asked men if they had seen His
Lover, and they asked Him: &#8216;What are the
qualities of Thy Lover?&#8217; And the Beloved said:
&#8216;My Lover is ardent yet fearful; rich and yet poor;
joyful, sad and pensive; and every day he grieves
because of his love.&#8217;</p>

<p>268 &nbsp; They asked the Lover: &#8216;Wilt thou sell thy
desire?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;I have sold it already to
my Beloved, for such a price as would buy the whole
world.&#8217;</p>

<p>269 &nbsp; &#8216;Preach, O Fool, speak concerning thy
Beloved; weep and fast.&#8217; So the Lover renounced
the world, and went forth lovingly to seek his
Beloved, and to praise Him in those places wherein
He was dishonoured.</p>

<p>270 &nbsp; The Lover builded a fair city wherein his
Beloved might dwell; of love, thoughts, tears,
complaints and griefs he builded it; with joy,
devotion and hope he adorned it; and with justice,
prudence, faith, fortitude and temperance he
furnished it.</p>

<p>271 &nbsp; The Lover drank of love at the fountain of
the Beloved, and there the Beloved washed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Lover&#8217;s feet, though many a time he had despised
and forgotten His greatness, and the world had
suffered thereby.</p>

<p>272 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Fool, what is sin?&#8217; He answered:
&#8216;It is the turning and directing of the intention
away from the final Cause and Intention for which
all things have been created by my Beloved.&#8217;</p>

<p>273 &nbsp; The Lover saw that the world was created so
that eternity should be more in harmony with his
Beloved, who is Infinite Essence of greatness and
all perfection, than with the world, which is a finite
quantity; and therefore the justice of his Beloved
was before time and finite quantities were.</p>

<p>274 &nbsp; The Lover defended his Beloved against those
who said that the world is eternal, saying that the
justice of his Beloved would not be perfect, if He
restored not to every man his own body, and for
this no place or material order would suffice; nor,
if the world were eternal, could it be ordered for one
end only; and yet, if it were not so ordered, there
would be wanting in his Beloved perfection of
wisdom and will.</p>

<p>275 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Fool, wherein is the beginning of
wisdom?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;In faith and devotion,
which are a ladder whereby understanding may rise
to a comprehension of the secrets of my Beloved.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>276 &nbsp; &#8216;Where then have faith and devotion their
beginning?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;In my Beloved, who
illumines faith and nurtures devotion.&#8217;</p>

<p>277 &nbsp; They asked the Lover: &#8216;Which is greater&mdash;the
possible or the impossible?&#8217; He answered:
&#8216;The possible is greater in man, and the impossible
in my Beloved, since power and possibility are in
agreement, and impossibility and actuality.&#8217;</p>

<p>278 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Fool, which is the greater&mdash;difference
or harmony?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;Save in my Beloved,
difference is greater in plurality, and harmony
in unity; but in my Beloved they are equal in
plurality and in unity.&#8217;</p>

<p>279 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Lover, what is true worth?&#8217; He
answered: &#8216;It is the opposite of this world&#8217;s worth,
which false and vainglorious lovers desire; for
they go after worth and achieve only worthlessness.&#8217;</p>

<p>280 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Fool, hast thou seen one without his
reason?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;I have seen a lord of the
Church, who had many cups on his table, and many
plates and knives of silver, and in his chamber had
many garments and a great bed, and in his coffers
great wealth&mdash;and at the gates of his palace but
few poor.&#8217;</p>

<p>281 &nbsp; &#8216;Knowest thou, O Fool, what is evil?&#8217;
He answered: &#8216;Evil thoughts.&#8217; &#8216;And what is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
loyalty?&#8217; &#8216;It is fear of my Beloved, born of
charity and of shame which men reproach.&#8217; &#8216;And
what is honour?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;It is to think
on my Beloved, to desire Him and to praise His
glorious Name.&#8217;</p>

<p>282 &nbsp; The Lover went one day into a cloister, and
the monks inquired of him if he, too, were a religious.
&#8216;Yea,&#8217; he answered, &#8216;of the order of my Beloved.&#8217;
&#8216;What rule dost thou follow?&#8217; He answered:
&#8216;My Beloved&#8217;s.&#8217; &#8216;To whom art thou vowed?&#8217;
He said: &#8216;To my Beloved.&#8217; &#8216;Hast thou thy
will?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;Nay, it is given to my
Beloved.&#8217; &#8216;Hast thou added aught to the rule of
thy Beloved?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;Naught can be
added to that which is already perfect. And
why,&#8217; continued the Lover, &#8216;do not you that are
religious take the Name of my Beloved? May it
not be that, as you bear the name of another, your
love may grow less, and, hearing the voice of another,
you may not catch the voice of the Beloved?&#8217;</p>

<p>283 &nbsp; The trials and tribulations that the Lover endured
for love&#8217;s sake made him weary and apt to be
impatient; and the Beloved reproved him, saying
that he whom either trouble or happiness affected
thus knew but little of love. So the Lover was
contrite and wept, and he begged his Beloved to
restore his love again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>284 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Fool, what is love?&#8217; He answered:
&#8216;Love is that which throws the free into bondage,
and to those that are in bonds gives liberty.&#8217; And
who can say whether in love there is more of liberty
or of bondage?</p>

<p>285 &nbsp; The Beloved called His Lover, and he
answered Him, saying: &#8216;What wilt Thou, O my
Beloved, Thou who art the sight of my eyes, thought
of my thoughts, love of my love and sum of my perfections,&mdash;yea,
and the source of all my beginnings?&#8217;</p>

<p>286 &nbsp; &#8216;O my Beloved,&#8217; said the Lover, &#8216;I come to
Thee, I walk in Thee, for Thou dost call me.
And I greet Thee with Thine own Sign, by which
I hope for eternal life and eternal blessing.&#8217;</p>

<p>287 &nbsp; The Lover cried aloud and said: &#8216;Fire gives
warmth, its heat gives lightness, and that lightness
draws on high. And in like manner love inflames
the thoughts, gives lightness and draws on high.
And one love unites three things, binding them
securely the one to the others.&#8217;</p>

<p>288 &nbsp; They asked the Lover: &#8216;What is the world?&#8217;
He answered: &#8216;It is a book for such as can read, in
which is revealed my Beloved.&#8217; They asked him:
&#8216;Is thy Beloved, then, in the world?&#8217; He answered:
&#8216;Yea, even as the writer is in his book.&#8217; &#8216;And
wherein consists this book?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
my Beloved, since my Beloved contains it all, and
therefore is the world in my Beloved rather than
my Beloved in the world.&#8217;</p>

<p>289 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Lover, who is he that loves and seems
to thee as a fool?&#8217; The Lover answered: &#8216;He
that loves the shadow and makes no account of the
truth.&#8217; &#8216;And whom dost thou call rich?&#8217; &#8216;He
that loves truth.&#8217; &#8216;And who is poor?&#8217; &#8216;He that
loves falsehood.&#8217;</p>

<p>290 &nbsp; They asked the Lover: &#8216;Is the world to be
loved?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;Truly it is, but as a
piece of work, for its artificer&#8217;s sake, or as the night
by reason of the day which follows it.&#8217;</p>

<p>291 &nbsp; The Lover cried out to his Lord concerning
his Beloved, and to his Beloved concerning his
Lord. And the Lord and the Beloved said: &#8216;Who
is this that makes division in Us, that are One only?&#8217;
The Lover answered and said: &#8216;It is pity, which
belongs to the Lord, and tribulation, which comes
through the Beloved.&#8217;</p>

<p>292 &nbsp; The Lover was in peril in the great ocean of
love, and he trusted in his Beloved, who came to him
with troubles, thoughts, tears, sighs and griefs; for
the ocean was of love.</p>

<p>293 &nbsp; The Lover rejoiced in the Being of his Beloved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
for (said he) from His Being is all other Being
derived, and by It sustained, and made subject and
constrained to honour and serve my Beloved. By
no being can He be condemned or destroyed, or
made greater or less.</p>

<p>294 &nbsp; &#8216;What is the Being of thy Beloved?&#8217; He
answered: &#8216;It is a bright ray throughout all things,
even as the sun which shines over all the world.
For if it withdraw its brightness, it leaves all things
in darkness, and when it shines forth it brings the
day. Even more so is my Beloved.&#8217;</p>

<p>295 &nbsp; &#8216;My Beloved is one, and in His unity my
thoughts and my love are united in one will; my
Beloved&#8217;s unity is the source of all unities and all
pluralities; and His plurality of all pluralities and
unities.&#8217;</p>

<p>296 &nbsp; &#8216;O Beloved, by Thy greatness my desires, my
thoughts and my afflictions are made great; for so
great art Thou that all things which have remembrance
and joy and understanding of Thee are great;
and Thy greatness makes all things small which are
contrary to Thy honour and commandments.&#8217;</p>

<p>297 &nbsp; &#8216;Thou knowest my sinfulness, O Beloved;
be merciful, then, and pardon. Thou knowest
better than I who Thou art; yet even I know Thy
pardon and love, since Thou hast awakened in me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
contrition and pain, and the desire to die a shameful
death that Thy Name may be thereby exalted.&#8217;</p>

<p>298 &nbsp; &#8216;Thy power, O Beloved, can save me through
Thy goodness, mercy and pardon, yet it can condemn
me through Thy justice, and my failures and imperfections.
But let Thy power work its will in
me, for it is wholly perfection, whether it bring
salvation or eternal punishment.&#8217;</p>

<p>299 &nbsp; &#8216;O Truth that I love, visit my contrite heart,
draw water from mine eyes, that my will may love
Thee; and since Thy truth, O Beloved, is sovereign,
draw truth from my will, that I may honour Thy
Name, and cause it to hate my shortcomings.&#8217;</p>

<p>300 &nbsp; The Lover gazed at the rainbow, and it
seemed to him as though it were of three colours.
And he cried: &#8216;O marvellous distinction of three,
for the three together are one! And how can this
be in the image, unless it be so of itself, in truth?&#8217;</p>

<p>301 &nbsp; The Beloved created, and the Lover destroyed.
The Beloved judged, and the Lover wept. Then
the Beloved created glory again for the Lover. The
Beloved finished His work, and the Lover remained
for ever in the companionship of his Beloved.</p>

<p>302 &nbsp; By verdant paths, with feeling, imagination,
understanding and will, the Lover went in search of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
his Beloved. And in those paths the Lover endured
griefs and perils for his Beloved&#8217;s sake, that
he might lift up his will and understanding to his
Beloved, who wills that His lovers may comprehend
and love Him exceedingly.</p>

<p>303 &nbsp; The perfection of the Beloved uplifted His
Lover, and his own shortcomings cast him down.
Which of these two forces, think you, has by nature
the greater power over the Lover?</p>

<p>304 &nbsp; &#8216;Thou hast placed me, O my Beloved, between
my evil and Thy good. On Thy part may there be
mercy and pity, patience, humility, pardon, restoration
and help; on mine let there be contrition,
perseverance and remembrance of Thy sacred
Passion, with sighs and tears.&#8217;</p>

<p>305 &nbsp; &#8216;O Beloved, that makest me to love, if Thou
aidest me not, why didst Thou will to create me, and
why didst Thou endure grief for my sake and bear
Thy so grievous Passion? Since Thou didst help
me thus to rise, my Beloved, help me also to descend
to the remembrance and hatred of my faults and
failings, that my thoughts may the better rise again
to desire, honour and praise Thee.&#8217;</p>

<p>306 &nbsp; &#8216;My will, O Beloved, hast Thou made free to
love Thy honour or despise Thy worth, that in my
will my love to Thee may be increased; and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
granting me this liberty, O Beloved, hast Thou put
my will into danger. Remember, then, Thy Lover
in this danger, that I may place in servitude my free
will, praise Thy honour, and multiply tears and
grief in my heart.&#8217;</p>

<p>307 &nbsp; &#8216;O Beloved, never from Thee came fault nor
failing to Thy Lover, nor can Thy Lover attain to
perfection but through Thy grace and mercy.
Then, since the Lover has Thee in such possessions,
do Thou remember him in his perils and tribulations.&#8217;</p>

<p>308 &nbsp; &#8216;O Beloved, who in one Name, Jesus Christ, art
called both God and Man, by that Name my will
seeks to adore Thee as God and Man. And if Thou,
Beloved, hast so greatly honoured Thy Lover,
through none of his merits, why honourest Thou
not so many ignorant men, who knowingly have
been less guilty of dishonouring Thy Name, Jesus
Christ, than has this Thy Lover?&#8217;</p>

<p>309 &nbsp; The Lover wept, and he spake to his Beloved
in these words: &#8216;O Beloved, never wert Thou
sparing or aught but liberal to Thy Lover, in giving
him being or in granting him many creatures to
serve him. Then wherefore, O Beloved, Thou who
art sovereign liberality, shouldst Thou be slow to
give Thy Lover tears, thoughts, griefs, wisdom and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
love that he may do honour to Thy Name? So
then, O Beloved, Thy Lover asks of Thee long life
that he may receive of Thee many of the gifts
aforesaid.&#8217;</p>

<p>310 &nbsp; &#8216;O Beloved, if Thou dost help just men against
their mortal enemies, help to increase my thoughts
and desires for Thy honour. And if Thou dost help
sinners to lead just lives, help Thy Lover that he
may sacrifice his will to Thy glory; and as to his
body, that he may tread the martyr&#8217;s path as a
testimony of love.&#8217;</p>

<p>311 &nbsp; The Lover made complaint to his Beloved of
temptations which came to him daily to disturb his
thoughts. And the Beloved answered him: &#8216;Such
temptations are occasions of recourse to the memory,
that the lover may think upon God and love His
grace and honour.&#8217;</p>

<p>312 &nbsp; The Beloved had mercy upon His Lover,
because of His perfect love, and because of His
Lover&#8217;s needs. Which of those two reasons, think
you, moved the Beloved the more strongly to
forgive His Lover&#8217;s sins?</p>

<p>313 &nbsp; Our Lady and the Saints and angels in glory
cried to my Beloved: &#8216;Remember the errors into
which the world has fallen through ignorance, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
remember how great is Thy justice, O Beloved, and
how great the ignorance of Thine enemies.&#8217;</p>

<p>314 &nbsp; The Lover lifted up the powers of his soul,
and mounted the ladder of humanity to glory in
the Divine Nature; and from the Divine Nature
the powers of his soul descended, to glory in the
human nature of his Beloved.</p>

<p>315 &nbsp; The straiter are the paths along which the
Lover journeys to his Beloved, the vaster is his love;
and the straiter his love, the broader are the paths.
So that however it be the Lover receives love, trials
and griefs, comforts and joys from his Beloved.</p>

<p>316 &nbsp; Love comes from love, thoughts from thoughts
and tears from griefs; and love leads to love, as
thoughts lead to tears and griefs to sighs. And the
Beloved watches His Lover, who bears all these
afflictions for His love.</p>

<p>317 &nbsp; The desires of the Lover and his memories of
the Beloved&#8217;s greatness kept vigils and went on
journeys and pilgrimages. And they brought to the
Lover graces which lit up his understanding and
made his will to increase in love.</p>

<p>318 &nbsp; With his imagination the Lover formed and
pictured his Beloved&#8217;s Countenance in bodily wise,
and with his understanding he beautified It in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
spiritual things; and with his will he worshipped
It in all creatures.</p>

<p>319 &nbsp; The Lover purchased a day of tears with
another of thoughts; and a day of love came
through a day of tribulations; and both his thoughts
and his love were increased.</p>

<p>320 &nbsp; The Lover was in a far country, and he forgot
his Beloved, but was sad at the absence of his lord,
his wife, his children and his friends. But soon
the memory of his Beloved returned to him, that
he might be comforted, and that his exile might
cause him neither vexation nor sorrow.</p>

<p>321 &nbsp; The Lover heard his Beloved&#8217;s words; his
understanding beheld Him in them; his will had
pleasure in that which he heard; and his memory
recalled his Beloved&#8217;s virtues and His promises.</p>

<p>322 &nbsp; The Lover heard men speak evil of his Beloved,
and in this evil-speaking his understanding
perceived his Beloved&#8217;s justice and patience; for
His justice would punish the evil-speakers, while His
patience would await their contrition and repentance.
In which of these two think you that the Lover
believed more earnestly?</p>

<p>323 &nbsp; The Lover fell sick, and made his testament
with the counsel of his Beloved. His sins and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
faults he bequeathed to penance and contrition;
worldly pleasures to contempt. To his eyes he left
tears; to his heart sighs of love; to his understanding
his Beloved&#8217;s graces, and to his memory the
Passion which his Beloved endured for love of him.
And to his activity he bequeathed the guidance of unbelievers,
who go to their doom through ignorance.</p>

<p>324 &nbsp; The scent of flowers brought to the Lover&#8217;s
mind the evil stench of riches and meanness, of old
age and lasciviousness, of discontent and pride.
The taste of sweet things recalled to him the bitterness
of temporal possessions and of entering and
quitting this world. The enjoyment of earthly
pleasures made him feel how quickly this world
passes, and how the delights which are here so
pleasant may be the occasion of eternal torments.</p>

<p>325 &nbsp; The Lover endured hunger and thirst, cold
and heat, poverty and nakedness, sickness and
tribulations; and he would have died had he not
had remembrance of his Beloved, who healed him
with hope and memory, with the renunciation of
this world and contempt for the revilings of men.</p>

<p>326 &nbsp; The Lover made his bed between trials and
joys: in joys he lay down to sleep and in trials he
awakened. Which of these two, think you, was
nearer to the bed of the Lover?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>327 &nbsp; In anger the Lover lay down to sleep, resenting
the revilings of men; in patience he awakened,
remembering his Beloved. Which, think
you, did the Lover feel the more deeply&mdash;the love
of his Beloved or the scorn of men?</p>

<p>328 &nbsp; The Lover thought upon death, and he was
afraid, until he remembered the city of his Beloved,
to which love and death are the gates and the
entrance.</p>

<p>329 &nbsp; Two men were disputing concerning simplicity,
the one against the other. And the one
said: &#8216;The simple man is he who knows nothing.&#8217;
The other said: &#8216;The simple man is he who lives
without sin.&#8217; And the Lover came and said:
&#8216;True simplicity has he who commits all his ways
to my Beloved.&#8217;</p>

<p>330 &nbsp; &#8216;For simplicity is to exalt faith above understanding,
which it so far exceeds, and in all that
pertains to my Beloved it is to avoid completely all
things vain, superfluous, curious, over-subtle and
presumptuous. For all these are contrary to
simplicity.&#8217;</p>

<p>331 &nbsp; Another time they both inquired of him,
asking that he would tell them if the science of the
simple is a great one. He answered: &#8216;The science
of great sages is as a great heap of a few grains, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the science of the simple is a small heap of numberless
grains, because neither presumption nor
curiosity nor over-subtlety are added to the heap
of simple men.&#8217; &#8216;And what is the work of presumption
and curiosity?&#8217; The Lover replied:
&#8216;Vanity is the mother of curiosity, and pride is the
mother of presumption, and therefore is their work
the work of vanity and pride. And the enemies of
my Beloved are known by presumption and curiosity,
even as love for Him is acquired by simplicity.&#8217;</p>

<p>332 &nbsp; The Lover lost a jewel which he greatly
prized, and was sorely distressed, until his Beloved
put to him this question: &#8216;Which profiteth thee
more, the jewel that thou hadst or thy patience in all
the acts of thy Beloved?&#8217;</p>

<p>333 &nbsp; Many lovers came together, and they asked
Love&#8217;s messenger where and in what thing the
heart was most ardently inflamed with devotion
and love. Love&#8217;s messenger answered: &#8216;In the
House of God, when we humble ourselves and
adore Him with all our powers; for He alone is
Holiest of the holy. And those that know not
how to do this, know not what it is truly to love
Him.&#8217;</p>

<p>334 &nbsp; The Lover thought upon his sins, and for fear
of hell he would fain have wept, but he could not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
So he begged Love to give him tears, and Wisdom
answered that he must weep earnestly and often,
but for the love of his Beloved rather than for the
pains of hell; for tears of love are more pleasing
to Him than tears shed through fear.</p>

<p>335 &nbsp; The Lover obeyed Wisdom; and, on the one
hand, he shed many and great tears for love&#8217;s sake,
and, on the other, few and small tears for fear, that
by love and not by fear he might honour his Beloved.
And the tears which he shed for love brought him
solace and rest, while the tears of fear gave him
sorrow and tribulation.</p>

<p>336 &nbsp; The Lover fell asleep while thinking on the
trials and the obstacles which he met in serving his
Beloved; and he feared lest through those hindrances
his works might be lost. But the Beloved
sent consciousness to him, and he awakened to the
merits and powers of his Beloved.</p>

<p>337 &nbsp; The Lover had to journey long over roads
that were rough and hard; and the time came when
he should set out, carrying the heavy burden that
Love makes his lovers to bear. So the Lover unburdened
his soul of the cares and pleasures of this
world, that his heart might bear the weight with
more ease, and his soul journey along those roads
in its Beloved&#8217;s company.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>338 &nbsp; Before the Lover, one day, they spoke ill of
the Beloved, and the Lover made neither reply nor
defence of his Beloved. Which, think you, was the
more to be blamed, the men who spoke ill of the
Beloved, or the Lover who was silent and defended
Him not?</p>

<p>339 &nbsp; As the Lover contemplated his Beloved, his
understanding conceived subtleties and his will
loved Him more and more. In which of the two
think you that memory grew more fruitful in
thinking on the Beloved?</p>

<p>340 &nbsp; With fervour and fear the Lover journeyed
abroad to honour his Beloved. Fervour bore him
along and fear preserved him from danger. And
while the Lover was journeying thus, he found sighs
and tears, which brought him greetings from his
Beloved. Through which of these four companions
think you that the Lover received the
greatest consolation in his Beloved?</p>

<p>341 &nbsp; The Lover gazed upon himself that he might
be a mirror in which to behold his Beloved; and
he gazed upon his Beloved, as in a mirror wherein
he could learn to know himself. Which of these
two mirrors, think you, was the nearer to his understanding?</p>

<p>342 &nbsp; They asked the Lover in what manner the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
heart of man was turned towards the love of his
Beloved. He answered them and said: &#8216;Even as
the sunflower turns to the sun.&#8217; &#8216;How is it, then,
that all men love not thy Beloved?&#8217; He answered:
&#8216;They that love Him not have night in their hearts,
because of their sin.&#8217;</p>

<p>343 &nbsp; Theology and Philosophy, Medicine and Law
met the Lover, who asked them if they had seen his
Beloved. The first wept, the second was doubtful,
but the other two were glad. What, think you,
was the meaning of these happenings to the Lover
that was seeking his Beloved?</p>

<p>344 &nbsp; Full of tears and anguish the Lover went in
search of his Beloved, by the path of the senses and
also by the intellectual road. Which of those two
ways, think you, did he enter first, as he went after
his Beloved? And in which of them did the
Beloved reveal Himself to him the more openly?</p>

<p>345 &nbsp; The Lover met an astrologer, and inquired
of him: &#8216;What means thy astrology?&#8217; He replied:
&#8216;It is a science that foretells things to come.&#8217;
&#8216;Thou art deceived,&#8217; said the Lover; &#8216;it is no
science, but one falsely so called. It is necromancy,
or the black art, in disguise, and the science of
deceiving and lying prophets which dishonour the
work of the sovereign Master. At all times it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
been the messenger of evil tidings; and it runs
clean contrary to the providence of my Beloved, for
in place of the evils which it threatens He promises
good things.&#8217;</p>

<p>346 &nbsp; The Lover went forth, crying: &#8216;Oh, how
vain are all they who follow after lust of knowledge
and presumption! For through lust of knowledge
do they fall into the greatest depths of impiety,
insulting the Name of God and with curses and
incantations invoking evil spirits as good angels,
inventing them with the names of God and of good
angels, and profaning holy things with figures and
images and by writings. And through presumption
all errors are implanted in the world.&#8217; And the
Lover wept bitterly, for all the insults which are
offered to his Beloved by ignorant men.</p>

<p>347 &nbsp; At the Day of Judgment the Beloved will
cause all that men have given Him in this world to be
placed on one side, and on the other side all that
they have given to the world. Thus it shall be
clearly seen to what extent they have loved Him, and
which of their two gifts is the greater and nobler.</p>

<p>348 &nbsp; The Lover&#8217;s will was enamoured of itself and
the understanding asked: &#8216;Is it more like the
Beloved to love oneself or to love the Beloved? For
the Beloved is to be loved more than anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
beside.&#8217; With what answer, think you, could the
will make reply to the understanding most truly?</p>

<p>349 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Fool, what is the greatest and noblest
love to be found in the creature?&#8217; He answered:
&#8216;That which is one with the Creator.&#8217; &#8216;And why
so?&#8217; &#8216;Because there is nothing with which the
Creator can make nobler a creature.&#8217;</p>

<p>350 &nbsp; One day the Lover was at prayer, and he
perceived that he wept not; and in order that he
might weep he bade his thoughts to think upon
wealth, and women, and sons, and meats, and
vainglory. And his understanding found that more
men have each of the things aforesaid to their
servants than has his Beloved. And thereupon were
his eyes wet with tears, and his soul was in sorrow
and pain.</p>

<p>351 &nbsp; One day the Lover was looking towards the
east, and towards the west, towards the south and
towards the north, and he espied the Sign of his
Beloved. And therefore he caused that Sign to be
engraven, and at each of its four extremities he had
a precious jewel set, as bright as the sun. That
Sign he wore ever upon him, and it brought the
Truth to his remembrance.</p>

<p>352 &nbsp; The Lover was walking pensively, thinking on
his Beloved, and he found on the way many people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and great multitudes who asked him for news. And
the Lover, who was rejoicing in his Beloved, gave
them not that which they asked of him, and said
that he could not reply to their words without departing
far from his Beloved.</p>

<p>353 &nbsp; Behind and before was the Lover vested in
love, and he went seeking his Beloved. Love said
to him: &#8216;Where goest thou, O Lover?&#8217; He
answered: &#8216;I go to my Beloved, that thou mayest
be increased.&#8217;</p>

<p>354 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Fool, what is Religion?&#8217; He
answered: &#8216;Purity of thought, and longing for
death by which the Beloved may be honoured, and
renouncing the world, that nothing may hinder
one from contemplating Him and speaking truth
of His Name.&#8217;</p>

<p>355 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Fool, what are trials, sighs, laments,
afflictions, perils, tears?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;The joys
of the Beloved.&#8217; &#8216;And why are they so?&#8217; &#8216;That
He may be the more deeply loved by reason of them,
and the Lover be the more bounteously rewarded.&#8217;</p>

<p>356 &nbsp; The Lover passed through divers places and
found many men who were rejoicing, laughing and
singing and living in great joy and comfort. And
he wondered if this world were meant for laughing
or for weeping.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>357 &nbsp; So the Virtues came, to pronounce upon that
question. And Faith said: &#8216;It is for weeping,
because the faithless are more in number than the
believers.&#8217; Hope said: &#8216;It is for weeping, because
few are those that hope in God, whereas many put
their trust in the riches of earth.&#8217; Charity said:
&#8216;It is for weeping, because so few are those that
love God and their neighbour.&#8217; And there followed
the other Virtues, and so declared they all.</p>

<p>358 &nbsp; The lovers sought to prove Love&#8217;s messenger,
and they said that they should go through the world,
crying that worshippers must honour servants as
servants and the Lord as a lord, so that their requests
might better be heard, and because there needs not
to love, save the Beloved.</p>

<p>359 &nbsp; They asked Love&#8217;s messenger whence came
to the Beloved so many useless servants, viler, more
abject, and more contemptible than secular men.
Love&#8217;s messenger answered and said: &#8216;They
come through the fault of those whose task it is to
furnish their Sovereign,&mdash;the King of Kings,&mdash;the
Beloved,&mdash;with servants. They make no question,
as they ought, concerning the wisdom nor the lives
nor the habits of those whom they choose. And
those whom they will not take for His train they
allow to serve the Eternal King in His palace, and
in the most holy ministry of His Table. Wherefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
ought they to fear the severest retributions when
they are called by the Beloved to their account.&#8217;</p>

<p>360 &nbsp; They asked the Lover: &#8216;In which is love
greater, in the Lover who lives or in the Lover
who dies?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;In the Lover who
dies.&#8217; &#8216;And why?&#8217; &#8216;Because in one who lives
for love it may yet be greater, but in one who
dies for love it can be no greater.&#8217;</p>

<p>361 &nbsp; Two lovers met: the one revealed his
Beloved, and the other learned of Him. And it
was disputed which of those two was nearer to his
Beloved; and in the solution the Lover took
knowledge of the demonstration of the Trinity.</p>

<p>362 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Fool, why dost thou speak with such
subtlety?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;That I may raise my
understanding to the height of my Beloved&#8217;s greatness,
and that thereby more men may honour, love
and serve Him.&#8217;</p>

<p>363 &nbsp; The Lover drank deeply of the wine of
memory, understanding and love for his Beloved.
And that wine the Beloved made bitter with His
Lover&#8217;s tears.</p>

<p>364 &nbsp; Love heated and inflamed the Lover with
remembrance of his Beloved; and the Beloved
cooled his ardour, with sorrows and tears and
forgetfulness of the delights of this world, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
renunciation of vainglories. So his love grew, when
he remembered wherefore he suffered grief and
affliction, and the men of the world persecutions
and trials.</p>

<p>365 &nbsp; They asked the Lover this question: &#8216;Wherein
dies love?&#8217; The Lover answered: &#8216;In the delights
of this world.&#8217; &#8216;And whence has it life
and sustenance?&#8217; &#8216;In thoughts of the world to
come.&#8217; Wherefore they that had inquired of him
prepared to renounce this world, that they might
think the more deeply upon the next, and that their
love might live and find nourishment.</p>

<p>366 &nbsp; &#8216;Say, O Fool, what is this world?&#8217; He
answered: &#8216;It is the prison-house of those that
love and serve my Beloved.&#8217; &#8216;And who is he that
imprisons them?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;Conscience,
love, fear, renunciation and contrition, and the
companionship of wilful men.&#8217; &#8216;And who is he
that frees them?&#8217; &#8216;Mercy, pity and justice.&#8217; &#8216;And
where are they then sent?&#8217; &#8216;To eternal bliss, and
the joyful company of true lovers, where they shall
laud, bless and glorify the Beloved everlastingly,
to whom be ever given praise, honour and glory
throughout all the world.&#8217;</p>
